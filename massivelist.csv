Risk-Based Human-Aware Multi-Robot Coordination in Dynamic Environments Shared with Humans,Z. Talebpour; A. Martinoli,"Civil and Environmental Engineering, School of Architecture, Lausanne, Switzerland; Civil and Environmental Engineering, School of Architecture, Lausanne, Switzerland",2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),6-Jan-19,2018,,,3365,3372,"In this paper, we propose a risk-based coordination method for the Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) problem in human-populated environments. We introduce risk-based bids that incorporate human trajectory prediction uncertainties and furthermore, social costs in their formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of including a predictive component in the risk formulation despite the lack of accurate position estimation for humans through an extensive suite of experiments. This is done by means of testing different levels of prediction error for known human trajectories and in a separate approach, using a Kalman filter for human trajectory estimation. Furthermore, we propose different risk formulations and evaluate their performance in a high-fidelity simulator. Additionally, a comparative study targeting human-agnostic planning at both navigation and planning levels, human-aware navigation and planning based on deterministic costs, and risk-based human-aware planning with no individual human-aware navigation has been conducted. Results confirm that risk-based bids lead to more socially acceptable team plans that reduce the need for the lower level individual human-aware navigation to be activated. Risk-based plans accounting for social costs prevent difficult social situations that can lead to less effective human-aware navigation, such as traversing narrow passages occupied by humans.",2153-0866,978-1-5386-8094-0,10.1109/IROS.2018.8593586,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8593586,,Robot kinematics;Task analysis;Navigation;Planning;Uncertainty;Estimation,human-robot interaction;Kalman filters;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;path planning;risk analysis;trajectory control,risk-based human-aware multirobot coordination;dynamic environments;human-populated environments;Kalman filter;position estimation;MRTA problem;human trajectory prediction;multirobot task allocation problem;human-aware navigation;risk-based bids;risk-based human-aware planning;human-agnostic planning;prediction error,,4,,29,IEEE,6-Jan-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Rapid Recovery from Robot Failures in Multi-Robot Visibility-Based Pursuit-Evasion,T. Olsen; N. M. Stiffler; J. M.

This is a computationally challenging task for which the best known complete algorithm takes time doubly exponential in the number of robots. However, recent advances that utilize sampling-based methods have shown progress in generating feasible solutions. An aspect of this problem that has yet to be explored concerns how to ensure that the robots can recover from catastrophic failures which leave one or more robots unexpectedly incapable of continuing to contribute to the pursuit of the evader. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm that can rapidly recover from catastrophic failures. When such failures occur, a replanning occurs, leveraging both the information retained from the previous iteration and the partial progress of the search completed before the failure to generate a new motion strategy for the reduced team of pursuers. We describe an implementation of this algorithm and provide quantitative results that show that the proposed method is able to recover from robot failures more rapidly than a baseline approach that plans from scratch.",2153-0866,978-1-6654-1714-3,10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636141,National Science Foundation; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636141,,Buildings;Task analysis;Robots;Intelligent robots,mobile robots;motion control;multi-robot systems;sampling methods,robot failures;rapid recovery;multirobot visibility-based pursuit-evasion;pursuer robots;two-dimensional polygonal space;computationally challenging task;complete algorithm;sampling-based methods;catastrophic failures;motion strategy,,2,,37,IEEE,16-Dec-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
"Scalable Distributed Planning for Multi-Robot, Multi-Target Tracking",M. Corah; N. Michael,"NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, CA, USA; Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Pittsburgh, PA, USA",2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),16-Dec-21,2021,,,437,444,"In multi-robot multi-target tracking, robots coordinate to monitor groups of targets moving about an environment. We approach planning for such scenarios by formulating a receding-horizon, multi-robot sensing problem with a mutual information objective. Such problems are NP-Hard in general. Yet, our objective is submodular which enables certain greedy planners to guarantee constant-factor suboptimality. However, these greedy planners require robots to plan their actions in sequence, one robot at a time, so planning time is at least proportional to the number of robots. Solving these problems becomes intractable for large teams, even for distributed implementations. Our prior work proposed a distributed planner (RSP) which reduces this number of sequential steps to a constant, even for large numbers of robots, by allowing robots to plan in parallel while ignoring some of each others’ decisions. Although that analysis is not applicable to target tracking, we prove a similar guarantee, that RSP planning approaches performance guarantees for fully sequential planners, by employing a novel bound which takes advantage of the independence of target motions to quantify effective redundancy between robots’ observations and actions. Further, we present analysis that explicitly accounts for features of practical implementations including approximations to the objective and anytime planning. Simulation results—available via open source release—for target tracking with ranging sensors demonstrate that our planners consistently approach the performance of sequential planning (in terms of position uncertainty) given only 2–8 planning steps and for as many as 96 robots with a 24x reduction in the number of sequential steps in planning. Thus, this work makes planning for multi-robot target tracking tractable at much larger scales than before, for practical planners and general tracking problems.",2153-0866,978-1-6654-1714-3,10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636729,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636729,,Target tracking;Uncertainty;Robot kinematics;Redundancy;Robot sensing systems;Planning;Sensors,mobile robots;multi-robot systems;optimisation;path planning;position control;target tracking,general tracking problems;scalable distributed planning;multirobot multitarget tracking;multirobot sensing problem;greedy planners;planning time;distributed planner;RSP planning;fully sequential planners;target motions;open source release;sequential planning steps,,3,,38,IEEE,16-Dec-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

MR-iSAM2 is based on a novel data structure multi-root Bayes tree (MRBT), which packs multiple Bayes trees with the same undirected clique structure. In multi-robot scenarios, the MRBT enables new measurements from different robots to be updated in different root branches, while all updates are performed around the single root of the Bayes tree in the original iSAM2 algorithm. As a result, the MRBT better reveals the underlying sparsity and information flow in multi-robot SLAM inference problems than the Bayes tree. Based on this insight, we further develop MR-iSAM2 to incrementally update and maintain the sparsity structure of the MRBT and enable efficient information propagation among the roots for inter-robot inference.

In this control approach, initially, the robots move as a group inside a circular region which we conceive to be the initial virtual structure, while preserving a specific pattern, say a triangular formation, among them. In order to avoid static/dynamic obstacles, while approaching towards the target without any prior knowledge about the environment, the virtual-circle is allowed to shrink up to a certain limit. The shrinking phenomena of the virtual circle will depend upon the number of agents within the circle and the distance between two the nearest obstacles sensed by the agents through which the swarm should be able to pass. If the situation demands, the structure may assume the shape of an ellipse of equivalent area continually throughout the path described by the swarm encapsulated within the variable structure. To achieve this, two-layer hierarchical control strategy has been proposed. Moreover, if the shape of the virtual structure changes, the formation of the swarm inside the region may also change. To make the inter-agent formation flexible inside the newly formed virtual structure, a spanning-tree-assisted-shape-matching algorithm has been employed for accommodating all the agents inside the virtual region which helps in the formation change in the agents as well.

Especially in complex dynamic environments, the coordination boost allowed by communication is critical to avoid collisions between cooperating robots.

Additionally, constant communication makes much of the still valuable information shared in previous time steps redundant. This paper presents an efficient communication method that solves the problem of ""when"" and with ""whom"" to communicate in multi-robot collision avoidance scenarios.

Given a graph, agents, their initial locations, and destinations, a solution of MAPF is a set of paths without collisions. Iterative refinement for MAPF is desirable for three reasons: 1) optimization is intractable, 2) sub-optimal solutions can be obtained instantly, and 3) it is anytime planning, desired in online scenarios where time for deliberation is limited. Despite the high demand, this is under-explored in MAPF because finding good neighborhoods has been unclear so far. Our proposal uses a sub-optimal MAPF solver to obtain an initial solution quickly, then iterates the two procedures: 1) select a subset of agents, 2) use an optimal MAPF solver to refine paths of selected agents while keeping other paths unchanged.

The system is composed of a server and a team of agents, here small aircrafts. Leveraging this architecture, computation-ally demanding tasks, such as global dense mapping and global path planning can be outsourced to a potentially powerful central server, limiting the onboard computation for each agent to local pose estimation using Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and local path planning for obstacle avoidance. By assigning priorities to the agents, we propose a hierarchical multi-robot global planning pipeline, which avoids collisions amongst the agents and computes their paths towards the respective goals. The resulting global paths are communicated to the agents and serve as reference input to the local planner running onboard each agent.

The algorithm takes inspiration from successful solutions to the discrete analogue of MRMP over finite graphs, known as Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). Specifically, we adapt ideas from Conflict-Based Search (CBS)-a popular decentralized MAPF algorithm-to the MRMP setting. The novelty of our approach is that we work directly in the continuous domain, without discretization. In particular, the kinodynamic constraints are treated natively. K-CBS plans for each robot individually using a low-level planner and grows a conflict tree to resolve collisions between robots by defining constraints. The low-level planner can be any sampling-based, tree-search algorithm for kinodynamic robots, thus lifting existing planners for single robots to the multi-robot setting.

Our method can augment existing synchronized decentralized receding horizon planning algorithms that utilize separating hyperplanes for collision avoidance thereby making them applicable to asynchronous setups. As an example, we extend an existing model predictive control based, synchronized, decentralized multi-robot planner using our method.

Trust But Verify: A Distributed Algorithm for Multi-Robot Wireframe Exploration and Mapping,A. Caccavale; M. Schwager,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA; Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA",2019 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),28-Jan-20,2019,,,3294,3301,"This paper presents a novel distributed mapping algorithm for multiple resource-constrained robots operating in a rectilinear 2D environment. The algorithm is built upon the sparse wireframe map representation and updating framework in [1]. We propose an exploration strategy based on the labeling of the vertices in the wireframe map, combined with a map-merging interrupt routine that is activated when robots enter into communication range with one another. The maps are not naively merged, but instead the receiving robot verifies the received information before it is assimilated by attempting to drive to the location where the other robot was when communication was established. The robots do not share a global coordinate frame, so prior to a merge the relative map alignment is determined. This is achieved using the random sample consensus (RANSAC) framework with a custom feature which leverages the structure inherent in the wireframe map representation. This results in a lower rate of false-positive matches compared to another state-of-the-art feature used in point cloud alignment, the 4-point congruent set (4PCS). We show our feature to be more robust to false-positive alignments, a common occurrence when attempting to align sparse structures such as wireframe maps.

This problem is challenging when each robot considers its path without explicitly sharing observations with other robots and can lead to non-stationary issues in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The typical CTDE algorithm factorizes the joint action-value function into individual ones, to favor cooperation and achieve decentralized execution. Such factorization involves constraints (e.g., monotonicity) that limit the emergence of novel behaviors in an individual as each agent is trained starting from a joint action-value. In contrast, we propose a novel architecture for CTDE that uses a centralized state-value network to compute a joint state-value, which is used to inject global state information in the value-based updates of the agents. Consequently, each model computes its gradient update for the weights, considering the overall state of the environment. Our idea follows the insights of Dueling Networks as a separate estimation of the joint state-value has both the advantage of improving sample efficiency, while providing each robot information whether the global state is (or is not) valuable.

The objective is to find an assignment of the robots to tasks that maximizes the team payoff. Each task is assigned to at most one robot and the resource constraint for each robot has to be satisfied with very high probability.

In this control approach, during the movement of a team of robots through an unknown occluded environment, a virtual boundary for the robotic crowd that could pass through even a very narrow passage, as a swarm, has been created based on the agents' /robots' sensing information. The primary challenge is to force each and every agent to fit into the arbitrary boundary, thus created, so that they can form a swarm and eventually progress towards the goal while avoiding obstacles. Consequently, the process maximizes the inter-agent cohesion. Furthermore, the virtual region is subdivided into so-called cells designated by a non-overlapping circular geometry. The utmost endeavor is to make an agent place itself at the center of a circular cell and a mechanism has been devised, where each agent is duly attracted and eventually is resident at the center of each cell completely blanketing the entire virtual region.

This is a continuous-cue target search, where multi-robot search algorithms like particle swarm optimization (PSO) can improve search time through parallelization. However, many robots lack global communication in large spaces, and PSO-based algorithms often fail to consider how robots disseminate target knowledge after a single robot locates it. We present a two-stage hybrid algorithm to solve this task: (1) locating a target with a variation of PSO, and (2) moving to maximize target knowledge across the group. We conducted parameter sweep simulations of up to 32 robots in a grid-based grayscale environment.

Recently, the frontier tree data structure was used in single robot exploration to memorize frontiers, their positions, exploration state, and the map. This tree could be queried to decide on further exploration steps. In this paper, we take the concept further for multi-robot exploration by proposing a new abstraction called the ‘group,’ meant to share information through a common frontier tree, requisite operations at the group level, and a method to assign goals to multiple robots. A group is a set of robots, the union of whose explored regions forms a contiguous region (a single connected region in a topological sense). As a group has precisely one tree, the robots share a common state of the exploration task. We propose techniques to merge groups and their frontier trees once their maps overlap. Finally, we suggest a method to designate and assign exploration goals to the individual robots by choosing nodes from the frontier tree.

However, humans have various preferences on balancing between task performance and safety, imposing different requirements onto MRS control. Failing to comply with preferences makes people feel difficult in operation and decreases human willingness of using an MRS. Therefore, to improve social acceptance as well as performance, there is an urgent need to adjust MRS behaviors according to human preferences before triggering human corrections, which increases cognitive load. In this paper, a novel Meta Preference Learning (MPL) method was developed to enable an MRS to fast adapt to user preferences. MPL based on meta learning mechanism can quickly assess human preferences from limited instructions; then, a neural network based preference model adjusts MRS behaviors for preference adaption. To validate method effectiveness, a task scenario ""An MRS searches victims in an earthquake disaster site"" was designed; 20 human users were involved to identify preferences as {""aggressive"", ""medium"", ""reserved""}; based on user guidance and domain knowledge, about 20,000 preferences were simulated to cover different operations related to {""task quality"", ""task progress"", ""robot safety""}.

Such algorithms are useful for collaborating robots to be resilient to reduction in connectivity of the communication graph of the robot team when robots can arrive or leave. These algorithms are also useful in a supervisory control setting when an operator wants to enhance the connectivity of the robot team. In contrast to many existing works that can only maintain the current connectivity of the multi-robot graph, we propose a generalized connectivity control framework that allows for reconfiguration of the multi-robot system to provably satisfy any connectivity demand, while minimally disrupting the execution of their original tasks. In particular, we propose a novel k-Connected Minimum Resilient Graph (k-CMRG) algorithm to compute an optimal k-connectivity graph that minimally constrains the robots' original task-related motion, and employ the Finite-Time Convergence Control Barrier Function (FCBF) to enforce the pairwise robot motion constraints defined by the edges of the graph.

The control law is based on a limited Voronoi partitioning of the sensing area, and we demonstrate that the group of robots can optimally cover the environment using only information that is locally detected (without communication).

In our previous work on implicit vision-based coordination, we demonstrated autonomous three-dimensional behaviors underwater by removing the need for radio communication between robots.

In each planning horizon, it generates collision-free paths that guide the robots to visit some obstacle-free locations (aka goals) not visited so far, which in turn help them explore some new regions with their laser rangefinders. We formally prove that, under reasonable conditions, it enables the robots to cover a workspace completely and subsequently analyze its time complexity.

This paper proposes a decentralized partially observable multi-agent path planning with evolutionary reinforcement learning (MAPPER) method to learn an effective local planning policy in mixed dynamic environments. Reinforcement learning-based methods usually suffer performance degradation on long-horizon tasks with goal-conditioned sparse rewards, so we decompose the long-range navigation task into many easier sub-tasks under the guidance of a global planner, which increases agents' performance in large environments. Moreover, most existing multi-agent planning approaches assume either perfect information of the surrounding environment or homogeneity of nearby dynamic agents, which may not hold in practice. Our approach models dynamic obstacles' behavior with an image-based representation and trains a policy in mixed dynamic environments without homogeneity assumption. To ensure multi-agent training stability and performance, we propose an evolutionary training approach that can be easily scaled to large and complex environments.

While navigating in complex urban environments, the Bayesian occupancy grid is one of the most popular types of maps, where the information of occupancy is stored as the probability of collision. Although widely used, this kind of representation is not well suited for risk assessment: because of its discrete nature, the probability of collision becomes dependent on the tessellation size. Therefore, risk assessments on Bayesian occupancy grids cannot yield risks with meaningful physical units. In this article, we propose an alternative framework called Dynamic Lambda-Field that is able to assess generic physical risks in dynamic environments without being dependent on the tessellation size.

The proposed mechanism enables the robot to move forward or backward and helically in pipes owing to rotation of the drive wheel and twisting of the body. These two movements are generated by a miter-geared differential mechanism installed in each joint, and the magnitudes of these movements depend on the load applied to the wheels and roll joints. However, controlling of two outputs independently and aligning the rotation of the roll joints as desired are extremely challenging. Therefore, in this study, we switch those two movements by driving the rear wheels and the front wheels of the robot alternately. In addition, a stopper is used to constrain the roll joint movement. By calculating the angle of elevation of the robot's helical movement in the pipe by using a kinematic model, we can design a stopper to precisely adjust the roll angle. We verified that the robot can twist using the differential mechanism, and we validated experimentally the effectiveness of the stopper.",2153-0866,978-1-5386-8094-0,10.1109/IROS.2018.8594208,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8594208,,Mobile robots;Wheels;Robot kinematics;Kinematics;Pipelines;Actuators,actuators;design engineering;drives;gears;mobile robots;motion control;pipes;robot kinematics;wheels,roll joint;single actuator;drive wheel;miter-geared differential mechanism;rear wheels;joint movement;helical movement;kinematic model;multilink articulated wheeled in-pipe robot;underactuated twisting joints;stopper angle design;roll angle,,4,,12,IEEE,6-Jan-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In this paper we propose a method for planning locomotion with multiple controllers and sub-planners, explicitly considering the multi-objective nature of the legged locomotion planning problem. The planner first obtains body paths extended with a choice of controller or sub-planner, and then fills the gaps by sub-planning. The method leads to paths with a mix of static and dynamic walking which only plan footsteps where necessary. We show that our approach is faster than pure footstep planning methods both in computation (2x) and mission time (1.4x), and safer than pure dynamic-walking methods. In addition, we propose two methods for aggregating the multiple objectives in search-based planning and reach desirable trade-offs without weight tuning. We show that they reach desirable Pareto-optimal solutions up to 8x faster than fairly-tuned traditional weighted-sum methods.

In the environment where the robot and humans are coexisting, the robot should always perform social navigation whenever it is moving. However, to perform social navigation, the robot needs to follow certain “social norms” of the environment. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique is popularly applied to the robotics field; yet, it is rarely used to solve the mentioned social navigation problem, generally deemed as a high dimension complex problem. In this paper, we propose the composite reinforcement learning (CRL) framework under which the robot learns appropriate social navigation with sensor input and reward update based on human feedback. For learning the aspect of human robot interaction (HRI), we provide a method to facilitate the training of DRL in real environment by incorporating prior knowledge to the system. It turns out that our CRL system not only can incrementally learn how to set its velocity and to perform HRI but also keep collecting human feedback to synchronize the reward functions to the current social norms. The experiments show that the proposed CRL system can safely learn how to navigate in the environment and show that our system is able to perform HRI for social navigation.",2153-0866,978-1-5386-8094-0,10.1109/IROS.2018.8593410,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8593410,,Navigation;Reinforcement learning;Legged locomotion;Task analysis;Collision avoidance;Robot kinematics,human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;path planning;service robots,minimum distance path;deep reinforcement learning technique;navigational movement;service robot;social robot navigation;CRL system;human robot interaction;human feedback;composite reinforcement learning framework;high dimension complex problem,,12,,18,IEEE,6-Jan-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In order to evaluate that behavior, we performed a user study to develop navigational algorithms that minimize entitativity. This study establishes mapping between emotional reactions and multi-robot trajectories and appearances, and further generalizes the finding across various environmental conditions. We demonstrate the applicability of our entitativity modeling for trajectory computation for active surveillance and dynamic intervention in simulated robot-human interaction scenarios.

Prior approaches implement specific web- compatible simulators or provide tools to build a simulator for a specific study. Instead, our approach builds on standard Linux tools to share a graphical desktop with remote users. We leverage these tools to deploy simulators on the web that would typically be constrained to desktop computing environments. As an example implementation of our approach, we introduce the SEAN Experimental Platform (SEAN-EP). With SEAN- EP, remote users can virtually interact with a mobile robot in the Social Environment for Autonomous Navigation, without installing any software on their computer or needing specialized hardware. We validated that SEAN-EP could quickly scale the collection of human feedback and its usability through an online survey. In addition, we compared human feedback from participants that interacted with a robot using SEAN- EP with feedback obtained through a more traditional video survey. Our results suggest that human perceptions of robots may differ based on whether they interact with the robots in simulation or observe them in videos.

However, it is not feasible to learn and benchmark social navigation behaviors entirely in the real world, as learning is data-intensive, and it is challenging to make safety guarantees during training. Therefore, simulation-based benchmarks that provide abstractions for social navigation are required. A framework for these benchmarks would need to support a wide variety of learning approaches, be extensible to the broad range of social navigation scenarios, and abstract away the perception problem to focus on social navigation explicitly. While there have been many proposed solutions, including high fidelity 3D simulators and grid world approximations, no existing solution satisfies all of the aforementioned properties for learning and evaluating social navigation behaviors.

State-of-the-art approaches to social navigation fall into two categories: model-based social constraints and learning-based approaches. While effective, these approaches have fundamental limitations – model-based approaches require constraint and parameter tuning to adapt to preferences and new scenarios, while learning-based approaches require reward functions, significant training data, and are hard to adapt to new social scenarios or new domains with limited demonstrations.In this work, we propose Iterative Dimension Informed Program Synthesis (IDIPS) to address these limitations by learning and adapting social navigation in the form of human-readable symbolic programs. IDIPS works by combining pro-gram synthesis, parameter optimization, predicate repair, and iterative human demonstration to learn and adapt model-free action selection policies from orders of magnitude less data than learning-based approaches. We introduce a novel predicate repair technique that can accommodate previously unseen social scenarios or preferences by growing existing policies.We present experimental results showing that IDIPS: 1) synthesizes effective policies that model user preference, 2) can adapt existing policies to changing preferences, 3) can extend policies to handle novel social scenarios such as locked doors, and 4) generates policies that can be transferred from simulation to real-world robots with minimal effort.",2153-0866,978-1-6654-1714-3,10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636540,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636540,,Adaptation models;Navigation;Training data;Maintenance engineering;Data models;Elevators;Iterative methods,iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;robot programming;social robots,Iterative Program Synthesis;adaptable social navigation;robot social navigation;human preferences;environment-specific scenarios;end-user adaptability;social navigation;model-based social constraints;learning-based approaches;model-based approaches;parameter tuning;human-readable symbolic programs;iterative human demonstration;model-free action selection policies;user preference;iterative dimension informed program synthesis;IDIPS;predicate repair technique,,,,22,IEEE,16-Dec-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

We determine the places from which a human, currently not visible to the robot, can appear suddenly and then adapt the path and speed of the robot with the anticipation of potential collisions.

Over the past decades, many impressed SLAM systems have been developed and achieved good performance under certain circumstances. However, some problems are still not well solved, for example, how to tackle the moving objects in the dynamic environments, how to make the robots truly understand the surroundings and accomplish advanced tasks. In this paper, a robust semantic visual SLAM towards dynamic environments named DS-SLAM is proposed. Five threads run in parallel in DS-SLAM: tracking, semantic segmentation, local mapping, loop closing and dense semantic map creation. DS-SLAM combines semantic segmentation network with moving consistency check method to reduce the impact of dynamic objects, and thus the localization accuracy is highly improved in dynamic environments. Meanwhile, a dense semantic octo-tree map is produced, which could be employed for high-level tasks. We conduct experiments both on TUM RGB-D dataset and in real-world environment. The results demonstrate the absolute trajectory accuracy in DS-SLAM can be improved one order of magnitude compared with ORB-SLAM2.

The TSDF is efficiently represented using voxel hashing, with most computations parallelized on a GPU. For detecting dynamics, we exploit the residuals obtained after an initial registration, together with the explicit modeling of free space in the model.

Although an occupancy map of the environment is sufficient for navigation of a mobile robot or manipulation tasks with a robotic arm in static environments, robots operating in dynamic environments demand richer information to improve robustness, efficiency, and safety. For instance, in path planning, it is important to know the direction of motion of dynamic objects at various locations of the environment for safer navigation or human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce directional statistics into robotic mapping to model circular data. Primarily, in collateral to occupancy grid maps, we propose directional grid maps to represent the location-wide long-term angular motion of the environment. Being highly representative, this defines a probability measure-field over the longitude-latitude space rather than a scalar-field or a vector-field. Withal, we further demonstrate how the same theory can be used to model angular variations in the spatial domain, temporal domain, and spatiotemporal domain.

Nonetheless, collisions may still occur in the interpolation/transition between two valid states or in environments with thin obstacles. In this work, we introduce a computationally inexpensive continuous-time collision avoidance term in presence of static and moving obstacles. Our penalty is based on conservative advancement and harmonic potential fields and can be used as either a cost or constraint in off-the-shelf non-linear programming solvers.

Finally, the proposed algorithm estimates the pose of a camera by taking advantage of the region classified as static parts. In order to evaluate the performance of visual odometry under the existence of dynamic rigid objects, we use self-collected dataset containing RGB-D images and motion capture data for ground-truth. We compare our algorithm with state-of-the-art visual odometry algorithms.

Despite intensive research on models of collective decision-making, the implementation in multi-robot systems is still challenging. Here, we advance the state of the art by introducing more plasticity to the decision-making process and by increasing the scenario difficulty. Most studies on large-scale multi-robot decision-making are limited to one instance of an iterated exploration-dissemination phase followed by successful and permanent convergence. We investigate a dynamic environment that requires constant collective monitoring of option qualities. Once a significant change in qualities is detected by the swarm, it has to collectively reconsider its previous decision accordingly. This is only possible by preventing lock-ins, a global consensus state of no return (i.e., a dominant majority of robots prevents the swarm from switching to another, possibly better option). In addition, we introduce a scenario of increased difficulty as the robots must locate themselves to assess the quality of an option. Using local communication, swarm robots propagate hop-count information throughout the swarm to form a global reference frame. We successfully validate our implementation in many swarm robot experiments concerning robustness to disruptions of the reference frame, scalability, and adaptivity to a dynamic environment.",2153-0866,978-1-7281-4004-9,10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8967777,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8967777,,,decision making;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;plasticity,dynamic environment;preventing lock-ins;large-scale multirobot decision-making;global reference frame;swarm robot experiments;plasticity;iterated exploration-dissemination phase;hop-count information;local communication,,5,,21,IEEE,28-Jan-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

This raw information is not suitable as a shared representation between the robot and its user. A semantic map, containing high-level information that both the robot and user understand, is better suited to be a shared representation. We use the semantic map as the user-facing interface on our fleet of floor-cleaning robots. Jitter in the robot's sensed raw map, dynamic objects in the environment, and exploration of new space by the robot are common challenges for robots. Solving these challenges effectively in the context of semantic maps is key to enabling semantic maps for lifelong mapping. First, as a robot senses new changes and alters its raw map in successive runs, the semantics must be updated appropriately. We update the map using a spatial transfer of semantics. Second, it is important to keep semantics and their relative constraints consistent even in the presence of dynamic objects. Inconsistencies are automatically determined and resolved through the introduction of a map layer of meta-semantics. Finally, a discovery phase allows the semantic map to be updated with new semantics whenever the robot uncovers new information.

The local collision avoidance module computes a set of safe controls that guarantees a safe distance between the moving objects. Both of the modules can be rigorously computed offline only once via formal methods. The patcher is activated whenever a moving obstacle is detected and modifies the static plan online for a short horizon by using only provably safe controls.

Motion planning methods for autonomous driving and mobile robots typically need to rely on the spatial constraints imposed by a map-based global planner to generate a collision-free trajectory. These methods may fail without an offline map or where the map is invalid due to dynamic changes in the environment such as road obstruction, construction, and traffic congestion. To address this problem, triangulation-based methods can be used to obtain a spatial constraint. However, the existing methods fall short when dealing with dynamic environments and may lead the motion planner to an unrecoverable state. In this paper, we propose a new method to generate a sequence of channels across different triangulation mesh topologies to serve as the spatial constraints. This can be applied to motion planning of autonomous vehicles or robots in cluttered, unstructured environments. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with other triangulation-based methods in synthetic and complex scenarios collected from a real-world autonomous driving dataset.

RF-LIO: Removal-First Tightly-coupled Lidar Inertial Odometry in High Dynamic Environments,,,2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),16-Dec-21,2021,,,4421,4428,"Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is considered to be an essential capability for intelligent vehicles and mobile robots. However, most of the current lidar SLAM approaches are based on the assumption of a static environment. Hence the localization in a dynamic environment with multiple moving objects is actually unreliable. The paper proposes a dynamic SLAM framework RF-LIO, building on LIO-SAM, which adds adaptive multi-resolution range images and uses tightly-coupled lidar inertial odometry to first remove moving objects, and then match lidar scan to the submap. Thus, it can obtain accurate poses even in high dynamic environments. The proposed RF-LIO is evaluated on both self-collected datasets and open Urbanloco datasets. The experimental results in high dynamic environments demonstrate that, compared with LOAM and LIO-SAM, the absolute trajectory accuracy of the proposed RF-LIO can be improved by 90% and 70%, respectively.

A typical approach to such problems is that a robot predicts the trajectories of dynamic obstacles, and plans its path while avoiding them. Such a formulation becomes limiting though for scenarios where an agent cannot complete its task efficiently, without disrupting the movement of dynamic obstacles. For example, when merging in heavy traffic or navigating through crowded corridors. In this paper, we propose a paradigm for planning in dynamic environments, called Disruption-Limited Planning (DLP), that allows a robot to disrupt the motions of dynamic obstacles in order to accomplish its task. DLP builds on the premise that while a robot may have to disrupt others’ trajectories to achieve its goals, it should try to limit the disruption. DLP assumes that it can estimate others’ response to its own actions/plans, and plans its own path while ensuring that no other agents’ disrupted trajectory cost gets worse than w-times their initial trajectory costs. While our formulation is motivated by the Stackelberg competitions, we show that DLP can be both more expressive and computationally more efficient compared to a Stackelberg planner. We present DLP paradigm, develop its efficient implementation based on A*, analyze its theoretical properties, and apply it to multiple planning in dynamic environment problems, including x,y,time planning, planning for self-driving, and planning for arm manipulation. We compare DLP with purely altruistic, purely egocentric, and optimal Stackelberg planners, demonstrating the efficacy of DLP over these alternatives.",2153-0866,978-1-6654-1714-3,10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636274,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636274,,Costs;Limiting;Navigation;Dynamics;Merging;Planning;Trajectory,collision avoidance;game theory;mobile robots;path planning,dynamic environment problems;time planning;DLP;robot navigation;dynamic environments;path planning;dynamic obstacles;robotics;called Disruption-Limited Planning;agents;initial trajectory costs;multiple planning,,,,24,IEEE,16-Dec-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

We extended it to have the capability of dealing with dynamic environments. Therefore, it must avoid global lock-in states. In many realistic applications the robot swarm needs to adapt to (collectively) measurable changes at runtime by revising previous collective decisions.

However, navigation in unseen dynamic scenarios without a pre-built map in the presence of dynamic obstacles still remains an open challenge. Since, learning accurate models for complex robotic scenarios such as navigation directly from high dimensional sensory measurements requires a large amount of data and training. Furthermore, even a small change on robot configuration such as kino-dynamics or sensor in the inference time requires re-training of the policy. In this paper, we address these issues in a principled fashion through a multi-constraint model based online planning (CoMBiNED) framework that does not require any retraining or modifications on the existing policy.

The first part can be formulated as either a mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) or NLP problem, while the second part is formulated as a series of standard convex optimization problems. Variants of the two wall climbing problem e.g., obstacle avoidance, uneven surfaces, and angled walls, help verify the proposed method in simulation and experimentation.",2153-0866,978-1-7281-4004-9,10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8968032,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8968032,,,convex programming;end effectors;integer programming;legged locomotion;path planning;walls,contact force;mixed-integer convex programming;standard convex optimization problems;wall climbing problem;motion planning trajectories;six-legged robot braces;multilimbed vertical climbing robots;MICP;NLP problem;nonlinear programming solver;torso postures;end effectors;optimization based motion planning,,11,,16,IEEE,28-Jan-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Our 3D bounding box prediction network is simple and light-weight by adding a small branch to a one-stage object detector. The network detects 2D projections of 3D bounding box vertices. Then, 3D points are reconstructed from the 2D results of the multiple viewpoints with camera motion information, i.e. extrinsic parameters, calculated from the robot joint angles. We also present generalized pose definition to address pose ambiguity of symmetric objects and keep consistency of geometric properties around feature points across both of the symmetric and asymmetric objects.

However, using language is seldom an easy task when humans need to express their intent towards robots, since most of the current language interfaces require rigid templates with a static set of action targets and commands. In this work, we provide a flexible language-based interface for human-robot collaboration, which allows a user to reshape existing trajectories for an autonomous agent. We take advantage of recent advancements in the field of large language models (BERT and CLIP) to encode the user command, and then combine these features with trajectory information using multi-modal attention transformers. We train the model using imitation learning over a dataset containing robot trajectories modified by language commands, and treat the trajectory generation process as a sequence prediction problem, analogously to how language generation architectures operate. We evaluate the system in multiple simulated trajectory scenarios, and show a significant performance increase of our model over baseline approaches. In addition, our real-world experiments with a robot arm show that users significantly prefer our natural language interface over traditional methods such as kinesthetic teaching or cost-function programming. Our study shows how the field of robotics can take advantage of large pre-trained language models towards creating more intuitive interfaces between robots and machines.

This paper proposes a novel concept of small-diameter multi-arm robot for SinglePort Access Surgery. The concept introduces a combination of backbone and actuation principles in a macro-micro fashion to achieve an excellent decoupling of the triangulation platform (macro) and of the end-effectors (micro). Concentric tube robots are used for the triangulation platform, while compliant fluidic-actuated bending segments are used as end-effectors. The fluidic actuation is advantageous as it minimally interferes with the triangulation platform.

Although this approach improves success rate, it requires a long time to execute a number of grasp trials, and single-arm grasping is only considered. However, robots can grasp more various objects with two arms, and dual-arm robots such as humanoid robots are expected to execute dual-arm manipulation and overcome the single-arm limitation. In this paper, we introduce dual-arm grasping as another possible strategy and propose a multi-stage learning method for selective dual-arm grasping using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)for grasping point prediction and semantic segmentation. In the first stage, the network learns grasping points with the automatic annotation. Although a robot learns both single-arm and dual-arm grasping efficiently with the annotation, the robot may not be able to grasp it because the annotation algorithm is designed by human. Therefore, for the second stage, the robot samples various grasping points with both grasping strategies and learns how to grasp in the real world. In this stage, the robot obtains new possible grasping points and prunes unsuccessful ones for both grasping strategies through the robot experience. In the experiments in the real world, the adapted network achieved high success rate 76.7% in 90 trials. Since the network trained with no adaptation stage resulted in lower success rate 56.7%, this result also shows the network was refined with less than 250 times of grasp sampling.

The integration of robots into retinal surgery has resulted in diminished surgeon perception of tool-to-tissue interaction forces due to robot's stiffness. The tactile perception of these interaction forces (sclera force) has long been a crucial source of feedback for surgeons who rely on them to guide surgical maneuvers and to prevent damaging forces from being applied to the eye. This problem is exacerbated when there are unfavorable sclera forces originating from patient movements (dynamic eyeball manipulation) during surgery which may cause the sclera forces to increase even drastically. In this study we aim at evaluating the efficacy of providing warning auditory feedback based on the level of sclera force measured by force sensing instruments. The intent is to enhance safety during dynamic eye manipulations in robot-assisted retinal surgery. The disturbances caused by lateral movement of patient's head are simulated using a piezo-actuated linear stage. The Johns Hopkins Steady-Hand Eye Robot (SHER), is then used in a multi-user experiment. Twelve participants are asked to perform a mock retinal surgery by following painted vessels inside an eye phantom using a force sensing instrument while auditory feedback is provided. The results indicate that the users are able to handle the eye motion disturbances while maintaining the sclera forces within safe boundaries when audio feedback is provided.",2153-0866,978-1-7281-6212-6,10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341350,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9341350,,Force;Surgery;Robot sensing systems;Retina;Sensors;Safety;Robots,biological tissues;biomechanics;biomedical measurement;eye;feedback;force measurement;force sensors;manipulators;medical robotics;phantoms;surgery,robot-assisted vitreoretinal surgery;multiuser study;tool-to-tissue interaction forces;patient movements;auditory feedback;force sensing instrument;Johns Hopkins Steady-Hand Eye Robot;mock retinal surgery;safe sclera force;tactile perception;dynamic eyeball manipulation;piezoactuated linear stage;eye phantom;painted vessels;eye motion disturbances,,1,,32,IEEE,10-Feb-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The interrupt mode exhibits significantly better performance, and it also supports generalization of the foot-strike event detector learned from data collected in slow locomotion to faster locomotion where the signals slightly change.

This scalability issue prevents MARL from being applied in large-scale multiagent systems. However, one critical feature in MARL that is often neglected is that the interactions between agents are quite sparse. Without exploiting this sparsity structure, existing works aggregate information from all of the agents and thus have a high sample complexity. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive sparse attention mechanism by generalizing a sparsity-inducing activation function. Then a sparse communication graph in MARL is learned by graph neural networks based on this new attention mechanism. Through this sparsity structure, the agents can communicate in an effective as well as efficient way via only selectively attending to agents that matter the most and thus the scale of the MARL problem is reduced with little optimality compromised. Comparative results show that our algorithm can learn an interpretable sparse structure and outperforms previous works by a significant margin on applications involving a large-scale multiagent system.",2153-0866,978-1-7281-6212-6,10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341303,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9341303,,Scalability;Aggregates;Reinforcement learning;Graph neural networks;Complexity theory;Intelligent robots;Multi-agent systems,graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems;neural nets,interpretable sparse structure;MARL problem;graph neural networks;sparsity-inducing activation function;adaptive sparse attention mechanism;sample complexity;large-scale multiagent system;scalability issue;adaptive sparse communication graph;robotic systems;multiagent reinforcement learning,,7,,32,IEEE,10-Feb-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In multiagent competitive scenarios, agents may have to adapt to new opponents with previously unseen behaviors by learning from the interaction experiences between the ego-agent and the opponent. However, this adaptation is susceptible to opponent exploitation. As the ego-agent updates its own behavior to exploit the opponent, its own behavior could become more exploitable as a result of overfitting to this specific opponent's behavior. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a safe adaptation approach in which the ego-agent is trained against a regularized opponent model, which effectively avoids overfitting and consequently improves the robustness of the ego-agent's policy. We evaluated our approach in the Mujoco domain with two competing agents. The experiment results suggest that our approach effectively achieves both adaptation to the specific opponent that the ego-agent is interacting with and maintaining low exploitability to other possible opponent exploitation.",2153-0866,978-1-6654-7927-1,10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981763,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9981763,,Technological innovation;Adaptation models;Buildings;Linear programming;Robustness;Behavioral sciences;Bayes methods,learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems,competing agents;complicated scenarios;ego-agent;fully autonomous robots;multiagent competition;multiagent competitive scenarios;possible opponent exploitation;regularized opponent model;safe adaptation approach;specific opponent;unseen behaviors,,,,38,IEEE,26-Dec-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

While useful for this purpose, this image-plane density has no immediate physical meaning because it is subject to perspective distortion. This is a concern in sequences acquired by drones because the viewpoint changes often. This distortion is usually handled implicitly by either learning scale-invariant features or estimating density in patches of different sizes, neither of which accounts for the fact that scale changes must be consistent over the whole scene.In this paper, we explicitly model the scale changes and reason in terms of people per square-meter. We show that feeding the perspective model to the network allows us to enforce global scale consistency and that this model can be obtained on the fly from the drone sensors.

Our proposed Learning to Balance (L2B) framework enables mobile robot agents to steer safely towards their destinations by avoiding collisions with a crowd, while actively clearing a path by asking nearby pedestrians to make room, if necessary, to keep their travel efficient. We observe that the safety and efficiency requirements in crowd-aware navigation have a trade-off in the presence of social dilemmas between the agent and the crowd. On the one hand, intervening in pedestrian paths too much to achieve instant efficiency will result in collapsing a natural crowd flow and may eventually put everyone, including the self, at risk of collisions. On the other hand, keeping in silence to avoid every single collision will lead to the agent's inefficient travel. With this observation, our L2B framework augments the reward function used in learning an interactive navigation policy to penalize frequent active path clearing and passive collision avoidance, which substantially improves the balance of the safety-efficiency trade-off. We evaluate our L2B framework in a challenging crowd simulation and demonstrate its superiority, in terms of both navigation success and collision rate, over a state-of-the-art navigation approach.",2153-0866,978-1-7281-6212-6,10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341519,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9341519,,Navigation;Swarm robotics;Reinforcement learning;Safety;Mobile robots;Collision avoidance;Task analysis,collision avoidance;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;navigation;pedestrians,safety-efficiency trade-off;interactive crowd-aware robot navigation;crowded place;mobile robot agents;crowd-aware navigation;pedestrian paths;natural crowd flow;interactive navigation policy;frequent active path clearing;passive collision avoidance;challenging crowd simulation;navigation success;collision rate;deep reinforcement learning,,13,,38,IEEE,10-Feb-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

We used the data to compare an instance of a rulebook [1], carefully hand-crafted independently of the dataset, with several interpretable machine learning models such as Bayesian networks, decision trees, and logistic regression trained on the dataset. To compare driving behavior, these models use scores indicating by how much different scenario traversals violate each of 14 driving rules.

Second, we found that the rulebook provides high interpretability without excessively sacrificing performance. Third, the data pointed to possible improvements in the rulebook and the rules, and to potential new rules.

Guided Second-Order Attention Network (GSAN) that, unlike the existing attention learning methods which are weakly-supervised, uses a supervisory signal based on the quality of the self-learned attention maps.

Coordination among multiple defenders is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we focus on the following two aspects: (i) estimating the probability density that describes the direction from which the next intruders are going to arrive, and (ii) partitioning of the space so that the defenders focus on capturing a disjoint subset of intruders.

This understanding consists of predicting future behavior of nearby vehicles and recognizing predefined rules. It is observed that not all rules have equivalent values, and the priority of the rules may change depending on the situation or the driver's driving style. In this work, we jointly reason both a future trajectories of vehicles and degree of satisfaction of each rule in the deep learning framework. Joint reasoning allows modeling interactions between vehicles, and leads to better prediction results. A rule is represented as a signal temporal logic (STL) formula, and a robustness slackness, a margin to the satisfaction of the rule, is predicted for the both autonomous and other vehicle, in addition to future trajectories. Learned robustness slackness decides which rule should be prioritized for the given situation for the autonomous vehicle, and filter out non-valid predicted trajectories for surrounding vehicles. The predicted information from the deep learning framework is used in model predictive control (MPC), which allows the autonomous vehicle navigate efficiently and safely.

To achieve this, we use Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability theory at the planning level to provide the robot planner with the foresight to avoid entering regions with possible inevitable collision. However, this alone does not guarantee safety. In conjunction with this HJ reachability-infused planner, we propose a minimally-interventional multi-agent safety-preserving controller also derived via HJ-reachability theory.

We show that, given a sufficient number of agents, the algorithm can successfully weed fields with various initial seed bank densities, even when multiple days are allowed to elapse before weeding commences.

Multi-agent policies are trained directly from images in simulation to control multiple instruments in a sub task of the minimally invasive removal of the gallbladder. These agents are evaluated individually and in cooperation with humans to demonstrate their suitability as autonomous assistants. Compared to human teams, the hybrid teams with artificial agents perform better considering completion time (44.4% to 71.2% shorter) as well as number of collisions (44.7% to 98.0% fewer). Path lengths, however, increase under control of an artificial agent (11.4% to 33.5% longer). A multi-agent formulation of the learning problem was favored over a single-agent formulation on this surgical sub task, due to the sequential learning of the two instruments.

We consider the ideal scenario where an agent can instantly share novel measurements, and we also consider the more practical scenario in which communication suffers from low bandwidth and is range-limited. For this scenario, an agent can only broadcast an informative subset of the novel measurements when the agent encounters other agents. We explore three different informative criteria for subset selection, namely entropy, mutual information, and a new criterion that reflects the value of a measurement. We apply our approach to three real-world datasets relevant to robotic mapping.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning has arisen as a powerful method to accomplish this task because it considers the interaction between agents and also allows for decentralized training—which makes it highly scalable. However, transferring policies from simulation to the real world is a big challenge, even for single-agent applications. Multi-agent systems add additional complexities to the Sim-to-Real gap due to agent collaboration and environment synchronization. In this paper, we propose a method to transfer multi-agent autonomous driving policies to the real world. For this, we create a multi-agent environment that imitates the dynamics of the Duckietown multi-robot testbed, and train multi-agent policies using the MAPPO algorithm with different levels of domain randomization. We then transfer the trained policies to the Duckietown testbed and show that when using our method, domain randomization can reduce the reality gap by 90%. Moreover, we show that different levels of parameter randomization have a substantial impact on the Sim-to-Real gap.

In contrast, we study whether scalability can also be achieved via a disentangled representation. For this, we explicitly construct an object-centric intermediate representation to characterize the states of an environment, which we refer to as ‘semantic tracklets.’ We evaluate ‘semantic tracklets’ on the visual multi-agent particle environment (VMPE) and on the challenging visual multi-agent GFootball environment. ‘Semantic tracklets’ consistently outperform baselines on VMPE, and achieve a +2.4 higher score difference than baselines on GFootball.

The development of distributed or parallel training techniques is also hindered by the global coupling among the agent dynamics, requiring simultaneous state transitions. This paper introduces Distributed multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with One-hop Neighbors (DARLIN). DARLIN is an off-policy actor-critic MARL method that breaks the curse of dimensionality and achieves distributed training by restricting the agent interactions to one-hop neighborhoods. Each agent optimizes its value and policy functions over a one-hop neighborhood, reducing the representation complexity, yet maintaining expressiveness by training with varying numbers and states of neighbors. This structure enables the key contribution of DARLIN: a distributed training procedure in which each compute node simulates the state transitions of only a small subset of the agents, greatly accelerating the training of large-scale MARL policies. Comparisons with state-of-the-art MARL methods show that DARLIN significantly reduces training time without sacrificing policy quality as the number of agents increases.",2153-0866,978-1-6654-7927-1,10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981441,"NSF(grant numbers:CAREER-2048266,CRI-1953048); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9981441,,Training;Couplings;Accelerated aging;Reinforcement learning;Benchmark testing;Complexity theory;Function approximation,multi-agent systems;reinforcement learning,DARLIN;distributed multiagent reinforcement learning;distributed training procedure;distributed training techniques;large-scale MARL policies;MARL methods;multiagent reinforcement learning;off-policy actor-critic MARL method;one-hop neighborhood;one-hop neighbors;parallel training techniques;policy functions;value function representations,,2,,24,IEEE,26-Dec-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Learning Human Rewards by Inferring Their Latent Intelligence Levels in Multi-Agent Games: A Theory-of-Mind Approach with Application to Driving Data,R. Tian; M. Tomizuka; L. Sun,"University of California, Berkeley; University of California, Berkeley; University of California, Berkeley",2021 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),16-Dec-21,2021,,,4560,4567,"Reward function, as an incentive representation that recognizes humans’ agency and rationalizes humans’ actions, is particularly appealing for modeling human behavior in human-robot interaction. Inverse Reinforcement Learning is an effective way to retrieve reward functions from demonstrations. However, it has always been challenging when applying it to multi-agent settings since the mutual influence between agents has to be appropriately modeled. To tackle this challenge, previous work either exploits equilibrium solution concepts by assuming humans as perfectly rational optimizers with unbounded intelligence or pre-assigns humans’ interaction strategies a priori. In this work, we advocate that humans are bounded rational and have different intelligence levels when reasoning about others’ decision-making process, and such an inherent and latent characteristic should be accounted for in reward learning algorithms. Hence, we exploit such insights from Theory-of-Mind and propose a new multi-agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning framework that reasons about humans’ latent intelligence levels during learning. We validate our approach in both zero-sum and general-sum games with synthetic agents, and illustrate a practical application to learning human drivers’ reward functions from real driving data. We compare our approach with two baseline algorithms. The results show that by reasoning about humans’ latent intelligence levels, the proposed approach has more flexibility and capability to retrieve reward functions that explain humans’ driving behaviors better.",2153-0866,978-1-6654-1714-3,10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636653,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636653,,Human-robot interaction;Reinforcement learning;Games;Cognition;Game theory;Intelligent robots,decision making;game theory;human-robot interaction;multi-agent systems;reinforcement learning,human-robot interaction;human driving behavior modeling;reward function;reward learning algorithms;multiagent inverse reinforcement learning;driving data;multiagent games;latent intelligence levels;theory of mind approach;decision making process;reasoning;zero-sum games;general-sum games,,2,,32,IEEE,16-Dec-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

We model the problem such that there is a penalty that accrues every time step if a point is left unmonitored. However, the dynamics of the penalty are unknown to us.

The graph attention allows agents to share their information with others leading to an effective joint policy. Our main focus is to understand how effective MARL is for the VPM problem. We investigate five research questions with this broader goal.

Specifically, the proposed scheme considers three behaviors: i) exploration, promoting separation and disconnection, ii) rendezvous to reconnect and share information gained during exploration, and iii) task allocation for prioritized objectives. Exploration is achieved via a Sobel edge detection frontier algorithm that enables navigation of unknown complex (both convex and non-convex) environments.

In particular, the proposed solution finds multi-agent paths on discrete spaces combined with a set of mutual observations at specific locations to detect robots with significant deviations from the preordained routes. In this paper, we develop a planner that works on continuous configuration spaces while also taking into account similar spatio-temporal constraints. In addition, the planner allows for more general tasks that can be formulated as arbitrary smooth cost functions to be specified. The combination of constraints and objectives considered in this paper are not easily handled by popular path planning algorithms (e.g., sampling-based methods), thus we propose a method based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).

The leader has specialized capabilities or mission critical information (e.g. goal location) that the followers lack, and this makes the leader crucial for the mission’s success. However, this also makes the leader a vulnerability -an external adversary who wishes to sabotage the robot team’s mission can simply harm the leader and the whole robot team’s mission would be compromised. Since robot motion generated by traditional leader-follower navigation algorithms can reveal the identity of the leader, we propose a defense mechanism of hiding the leader’s identity by ensuring the leader moves in a way that behaviorally camouflages it with the followers, making it difficult for an adversary to identify the leader. To achieve this, we combine Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Graph Neural Networks and adversarial training. Our approach enables the multi-robot team to optimize the primary task performance with leader motion similar to follower motion, behaviorally camouflaging it with the followers. Our algorithm outperforms existing work that tries to hide the leader’s identity in a multi-robot team by tuning traditional leader-follower control parameters with Classical Genetic Algorithms.

Robot hand controllers need dynamic pre-grasp planning capability, so they are not limited in dynamic tracking and catching tasks. To fill this gap, we explore the feasibility of using a two-stage optimization method to enable dynamic pre-grasp planning of individual fingers while tracking a moving object to ensure a later successful grasp. The first stage adopts multi-agent pursuit to partition the search space on the object surface. The method allows each finger to consider its immediate surroundings in a local view instead of globally determining the best location for all fingers. The search space for each finger is dramatically reduced since sensible alternatives are the ones left after pruning. Each finger goal location acts independently yet coordinates with others to achieve the goal of covering the object. In the second stage, four different goal point movement strategies are presented to impact the finger goal location in their respective search space to demonstrate the ability to facilitate different needs of the task and requirements of the designer. Dynamic finger goal adaption is obtained by iteratively updating these two stages.

Carlson,"Sikorsky Aircraft, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Stratford, Connecticut, USA; Sikorsky Aircraft, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Stratford, Connecticut, USA; Sikorsky Aircraft, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Stratford, Connecticut, USA; Sikorsky Aircraft, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Stratford, Connecticut, USA",2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),26-Dec-22,2022,,,12045,12050,"Multi-agent systems are deployed to accomplish tasks that take a long time with a single agent. The task allocation problem becomes particularly difficult when the objectives are conflicting with one another (e.g. minimizing the mission time while respecting the task priorities, while simultaneously maximizing agent's fitness for the task). This paper presents an algorithm to create task assignments for a group of autonomous agents with competing objectives. We consider a variety of constraints including agent capabilities to perform tasks, priorities set by a human supervisor, as well as temporal constraints such as arrival time or coalition formation. We propose a multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) that uses a hierarchical cost function by leveraging the paradigm of lexicographic optimization. The particles are driven by higher ranked objectives with lower ranked objectives used to break ties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm in a battlefield scenario where sub-teams of aerial vehicles are assigned to perform area reconnaissance, target strikes, and intelligence gathering.",2153-0866,978-1-6654-7927-1,10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981071,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9981071,,Particle separators;Reconnaissance;Cost function;Autonomous agents;Resource management;Task analysis;Particle swarm optimization,aerospace robotics;military robotics;mobile robots;multi-agent systems;particle swarm optimisation;remotely operated vehicles,aerial vehicles;area reconnaissance;autonomous agents;battlefield scenario;hierarchical cost function;higher ranked objectives;intelligence gathering;lexicographic optimization;lower ranked objectives;multiagent systems;multiobjective particle swarm optimization;multiobjective task allocation;PSO;target strikes;task assignments;task priorities;temporal constraint,,,,14,IEEE,26-Dec-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
