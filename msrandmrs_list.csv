For example, AGVs in warehouse as the agents cooperate with others and put on and off the supplies to organize them. Though Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning seems to make advantage to apply multi-robot and more domains, this method has some problems, in particular, it cannot consider the sensor resolution in real world problem. This paper addresses this problem as hetero informational problem, and discuss how to solve the problem by the topology and learning of the neural network of the deep reinforcement learning. Concretely, This paper employed Asynchronous Advantageous Actor-Critic (A3C) with some kinds of neural networks to discuss through two experimental cases, single and multi agent domains. This paper compared performance of agents with different number of hidden layers of neural networks in the single agent domain, and investigate the performance on the environment whose agents have different resolution each other in the multi-agent domain.","","978-1-6654-3632-8","10.1109/ISAMSR53229.2021.9567835","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567835","Multi-Agent System;Reinforcement Learning;Neural Network;Hetero Resolution;Abstraction","Learning systems;Network topology;Neural networks;Reinforcement learning;Robot sensing systems;Topology;Multi-agent systems","automatic guided vehicles;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems","MultiAgent system;different input resolutions;MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning;more domains;world problem;hetero informational problem;topology;neural network;deep reinforcement learning;single agent domain;multiagent domain;Learning method","","","","10","IEEE","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces Distributed Modular Memory Units (DMMU), a distributed multiagent learning framework. DMMU uses a shared external memory to enable one-shot adaptive learning in multiagent systems. The external memory is accessed by agents acting independently and in parallel. Agents operate by processing their individual states and deciding when to interact with the shared external memory unit. This allows agents to identify, retain, and propagate information among the team. Subsequently, DMMU can rapidly assimilate task features from a group of distributed agents and successfully use the information to accomplish distributed one-shot learning. We compare the performance of the DMMU framework on a simulated cybersecurity task with traditional feed-forward ensembles, long short-term memory based agents, and a centralized learner. Results demonstrate that DMMU shows at least 100% performance improvement over the other methods, and exhibits distributed one-shot learning to effectively solve this complex task.","","978-1-7281-2876-4","10.1109/MRS.2019.8901051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901051","","Task analysis;Servers;Multi-agent systems;Computer security;Feedforward neural networks;Logic gates;Knowledge based systems","distributed memory systems;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems","learning correct behavior;multiagent systems;pertinent information;emergent behavior;inter-agent interactions;distributed multiagent learning framework;one-shot adaptive learning;shared external memory unit;DMMU framework;short-term memory based agents;memory-based multiagent one-shot learning;modular memory units","","","","10","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the high computational complexity of the existing clustering algorithms has rendered them ineffective in several ways. Therefore, this study proposes a novel parallel clustering algorithm that integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with the K-means algorithm; hence, the proposed novel algorithm is termed Multi-agent-K-means (MK-means). The MK-means is based on the concept of separating the activating agents to perform clustering while considering a different subset of features for each agent. This is aimed at the preservation of the dataset while improving the clustering accuracy. The cluster centers are calculated for each partition before being merged and clustered again. The statistical significance of the proposed approach is provided. The effectiveness of the proposed MK-means clustering algorithm was evaluated using Wine datasets, and the performance is compared with that of the traditional K-means algorithm. The results analysis proved the superiority of the proposed MK-mean clustering algorithm over the traditional version of the K-means algorithm. This suggests the suitability of the proposed algorithm as a clustering technique that can also be applied to other clustering algorithms that are based on the concept of initial cluster centroids selection.","","978-1-6654-3632-8","10.1109/ISAMSR53229.2021.9567893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567893","K-means algorithm;clustering;decision-making;software agent;multi-agent system","Clustering methods;Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Computational complexity;Standards;Robots;Multi-agent systems","multi-agent systems;pattern clustering","activating agents;cluster centers;MK-means clustering algorithm;improved K-means clustering method;multiagent-k-means;initial cluster centroid selection;data generation;computational complexity;Wine dataset","","11","","24","IEEE","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Noise in the evaluation function can have a negative impact on evolutionary learning, especially in multiagent learning. The evaluation function for an individual agent can be noisy as each agent in the team changes their policies independently. Existing noise-reduction methods are not suitable for efficient evolutionary algorithms. The noise-reduction provided by actor-critic methods cannot be directly applied to the evolutionary algorithms when learning policies in episodic problems as the critic provides stepwise evaluations but evolutionary algorithms require episodic fitness evaluations. Fitness critics can provide noise-reduced episodic fitness evaluations by aggregating the multiple stepwise evaluations of an intermediate critic. With demonstrations on the tightly coupled multi-rover domain, this paper shows that teams trained with fitness critics achieve comparable or increased team performance scores compared to teams trained with other noise- reduction methods.","","978-1-7281-2876-4","10.1109/MRS.2019.8901056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901056","","Evolutionary computation;Noise measurement;Task analysis;Multi-agent systems","aerospace computing;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);planetary rovers;team working","fitness critics;noise-reduced episodic fitness evaluations;intermediate critic;multiagent learning;noise-reduced fitness evaluation functions;multiagent teams;evaluation function;evolutionary learning;noise-reduction methods;evolutionary algorithms;actor-critic methods;learning policies;tightly coupled multirover domain","","","","10","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different operators are applied for image texture extraction in order to obtain a unique identification of an image texture based on physical characteristics of the images. These operators are categorized into local and global texture analysis descriptors. This categorization is based on the properties of the operators and their features extraction methodology. However, each operator of a type has its strength and weakness in handling the deformations of the images including rotation, shear, region of interest, noise and variance of intensity. Subsequently, there is no operator that can perfectly handle all the deformation problems. To this end, this paper proposes a general framework of a Collaborative Multi-Agent Feature Extraction (CMAFE). The CMAFE framework deploys a multi-agent system to perform dynamic collaborations between the feature extraction operators. The operators are formed in a multi-agent system in which each agent implements an operator. This collaboration between the agents is based on a divide and conquer strategy. This strategy enables the operators to cope with the various challenges of deformations that are affecting the accuracy of the identification. The framework is meant to improve the image identification accuracy and reduce the universal search space of local and global operators which in return reduce the computational cost and time.","","978-1-5386-7856-5","10.1109/ISAMSR.2018.8540560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540560","Texture analysis;texture features extraction;multiagent system;collaboration;divide and conquer","Feature extraction;Strain;Multi-agent systems;Task analysis;Image texture;Collaboration;Statistical analysis","divide and conquer methods;feature extraction;image recognition;image texture;multi-agent systems;search problems","image pattern recognition applications;image texture extraction;deformation problems;CMAFE framework;multiagent system;feature extraction operators;image identification accuracy;collaborative multiagent feature extraction;texture analysis descriptors;multiagent features extraction operators;deformed image identification;image physical characteristics;divide and conquer strategy;search space","","6","","23","IEEE","22 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several surveys and reviews are illustrated in the literature regarding image texture and feature extraction using an agent and multi-agent-based systems. Nevertheless, few determinations are made in the context of the image texture feature extraction. Hence, the overall aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the image texture and feature extraction concepts depicted in the literature for characterizing regions in images by exploring the role and strategies of the agent and multi-agent systems (MAS). This paper tackles two behavior types, reactive agent (RA) and goal-directed agent (GDA), in terms of the natural surroundings of agent and multi-agent communications. In terms of MAS modeling, this paper tackles three types, including facilitator agent architecture (FAA), mediator agent architecture (MAA), an autonomous agent architecture (AAA). While for the MAS characteristics, five types are presented: interaction, coordination, cooperation, collaboration, and collectiveness. Finally, a discussion for agent and multi-agent-based feature extraction in image analysis is presented by comparing the strategies and the frequent use of the strategies in the literature. Based on this review, most of the feature extraction multi-agent-based systems rely on either coordinating or emergent-based strategies, while feature selection agent-based systems rely on collaborative strategies. However, there are several aspects that we can consider to be classified as agent-based strategies. This review develops a classification scheme for systems used in specific tasks of feature extraction.","","978-1-6654-3632-8","10.1109/ISAMSR53229.2021.9567863","Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia(grant numbers:H786); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567863","Image processing;image texture analysis;feature extraction;agent;multi-agent system","Image texture;Analytical models;Robot kinematics;Collaboration;FAA;Feature extraction;Autonomous agents","feature extraction;image texture;multi-agent systems","autonomous agent architecture;MAS characteristics;multiagent-based feature extraction;image analysis;feature extraction multiagent-based systems;emergent-based strategies;feature selection agent-based systems;collaborative strategies;agent-based strategies;image feature extraction;image texture analysis methods;image texture feature extraction;multiagent systems;behavior types;goal-directed agent;multiagent communications;MAS modeling;mediator agent architecture","","1","","83","IEEE","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network security is an important issue with connected networks and data communication between organisations of that specialized in different areas. Network security engineers spend a considerable amount of time to investigate network for security breaches and to enhance the security of their networks and data communications on their networks. They use Attack Graphs (AGs) which are graphical representation of networks to assist them in analysing large networks. With increase size of networks and their complexity, the use of attack graphs alone does not provide the necessary risk analysis and assessment facilities. There is a need for automated intelligent systems such as multiagent systems to assist in analysing, assessing and testing networks. Network systems changes with the increase in the size of organisation and connectivity of network of organisations based on the business needs or organisational or governmental rules and regulations. In this paper a multi-agent system is developed assist in analysing interconnected network to identify security risks. The multi-agent system is capable of security network analysis to identify paths using an attack graph of the network under consideration to protect network systems, as the networks grow and change, against possible attacks. The multiagent system uses a model developed by Mohammadian [3] for converting AGs to Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) to identify attack paths from attack graphs and perform security risk analysis.

Whether the unknown system consists of humans, robots, or other entities, the capability to discover the roles that various agents play in the multi-agent system is necessary to fully understand it. While existing work often focuses on predicting future trajectories or behaviors, there has been little research on identifying agents that share roles within a multi-agent system. Discovering shared roles enables a fuller understanding of the system and its future behavior, i.e., agents that share a role could be expected to behave similarly. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for role discovery in an observed multi-agent system. We first present a method to learn a unified temporal representation of the multi-agent system through a temporally weighted approximation of graphs describing relationships between agents at each time step. We then present our main contribution, where we formulate role discovery as a regularized optimization problem with the goal of learning the optimal role assignment based on the unified temporal representation. Our approach learns probabilities that agents play different roles while also discovering the number of distinct roles that exist in the multiagent system, and is proven to converge to the optimal solution. We also introduce a new role recognition dataset and evaluate on an existing dataset, showing that our approach outperforms existing methods in discovering roles in an observed multi-agent system.","","978-1-6654-2926-9","10.1109/MRS50823.2021.9620581","ARL(grant numbers:CA W911NF); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620581","","Costs;Autonomous systems;Clustering methods;Trajectory;Robots;Optimization;Multi-agent systems","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;probability","observed multiagent system;role discovery;unknown multiagent systems;unknown system;share roles;shared roles;optimal role assignment;matrix factorization;regularized optimization problem;unified temporal representation;recognition dataset","","","","38","IEEE","7 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The evaders being aware of the environment and the position of all pursuers follow a strategy to actively avoid being intercepted. We model the evaders' motion as a time-varying Markov process, and along with stochastic measurements, the pursuers use Markov Localization to update the probability distribution of the evaders. A search-based motion planning strategy is developed that intrinsically takes the probability distribution of the evaders into account. Pursuers are assigned using an assignment algorithm that takes redundancy into account, such that the estimated net time to capture the evaders is minimized.

Recently, various complex and distributed systems such as Internet of Things (IoT) systems are implemented where many sensors and data sources are allocated to collect heterogeneous data. These systems demand innovative and advanced data fusion methods. This paper presents an overview of agent and multi-agent roles in data fusion methods. Basically, agents provide features that enable complex and distributed systems to achieve deep data fusion in a collaborative multi-agent environment. Interaction among agents allows disseminating global overviews to a localized set of data fusion modules. There are different architectures to establish communication and authority among agents, such as (1) centralized, (2) decentralized, and (3) hybrid. Each of these approaches affords essential attributes of multi-agent systems (MAS). As a result, agents have the ability to improve communication and decision-making among data fusion modules and ensure producing better features or values during the fusion processes.","","978-1-6654-3632-8","10.1109/ISAMSR53229.2021.9567851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567851","Data fusion;heterogeneous data;decision-making;agent;multi-agent system","Interactive systems;Decision making;Data integration;Systems architecture;Distributed databases;Sensor systems;Data models","multi-agent systems;sensor fusion","complex distributed systems;deep data fusion;collaborative multiagent environment;data fusion modules;multiagent systems;data processing systems;Internet of Things systems;data sources;heterogeneous data;multiagent roles","","","","62","IEEE","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, there is a need for a method that is not only capable of efficiently solving the above two problems but also robust enough to solve a variety of tasks. To this end, we propose a new multi-agent policy gradient method, called Robust Local Advantage (ROLA) Actor-Critic. ROLA allows each agent to learn an individual action-value function as a local critic as well as ameliorating environment non-stationarity via a novel centralized training approach based on a centralized critic. By using this local critic, each agent calculates a baseline to reduce variance on its policy gradient estimation, which results in an expected advantage action-value over other agents' choices that implicitly improves credit assignment. We evaluate ROLA across diverse benchmarks and show its robustness and effectiveness over a number of state-of-the-art multi-agent policy gradient algorithms.","","978-1-6654-2926-9","10.1109/MRS50823.2021.9620607","U.S. Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-19-1-2131); Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-20-1-0265); NSF CAREER(grant numbers:2044993); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620607","","Training;Gradient methods;Estimation;Reinforcement learning;Benchmark testing;Robustness;Task analysis","deep learning (artificial intelligence);gradient methods;multi-agent systems;reinforcement learning","multiagent policy gradient algorithms;multiagent reinforcement learning;environmental stochasticity;ROLA;action-value function;local critic;environment nonstationarity;novel centralized training approach;centralized critic;policy gradient estimation;expected advantage action-value;credit assignment;robustness;robust multiagent deep reinforcement learning;robust local advantage actor-critic","","4","","33","IEEE","7 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work introduces Reactive Multi-Fitness Learning (R-MFL) to address both problems by separating “behaviors” and mission goals. R-MFL builds on Multi-Fitness Learning (MFL) that addresses which fitness matters when in complex and sequential tasks. R-MFL enables agents to change their set of behaviors instead of incorporating new insights into a single policy, while also determining when new behaviors are necessary. We show that the agents using R-MFL are able to react to unforeseen changes without catastrophic forgetting, and identify when and where they need to react during a deployment. R-MFL is shown to provide up to 90% improvement over MFL and 100% over a one-step evolutionary approach.","","978-1-6654-2926-9","10.1109/MRS50823.2021.9620689","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1815886); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-19-1-0195); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620689","","Training;Sociology;Computer architecture;Multi-robot systems;Task analysis;Statistics;Multi-agent systems","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems","remote missions;environmental conditions;longitudinal missions;single reward function;R-MFL;behaviors mission goals;complex tasks;sequential tasks;single policy;reactive multifitness learning;multirobot systems;robust multiagent teaming;one-step evolutionary approach","","","","31","IEEE","7 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The need for mobile networks with minimal infrastructure that can be easily used, has been aroused by the mobility advancement of people around the world. Such kind of networks is known as Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). The Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) is a popular routing protocol in the MANETs. Nevertheless, one issue of the AODV is the selection of routes based on minimum delay alone. Even though the delay is a significant parameter that has a direct effect on the performance of the network, other parameters such as energy consumption are necessary to establish efficiency routes. Therefore, this paper proposes employing a Multi-Agent System (MAS) for the establishment of efficient routes from the source to destination nodes in AODV, namely MAAODV protocol. The agents utilize the parameters of energy consumption, number of hops and delay to optimize the selection of the routes. The paper presents a simulation scenario to show the applicability of the proposed MAAODV routing protocol.","","978-1-5386-7856-5","10.1109/ISAMSR.2018.8540554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540554","Mobile ad hoc network (MANET);Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV);Multi-Agent System (MAS);Quality of Service (QoS)","Ad hoc networks;Routing;Mobile computing;Routing protocols;Quality of service;Delays;Optimization","mobile ad hoc networks;multi-agent systems;quality of service;routing protocols","MANET;mobile ad-hoc networks;ad hoc on-demand distance vector;multiagent system;MAAODV routing protocol;energy consumption;direct effect;minimum delay;AODV;mobility advancement;minimal infrastructure;mobile networks;wireless technology;mobile communication","","9","","42","IEEE","22 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If almost-surely winning strategies cannot be found for them, we deploy so-called least-limiting advisers to restrict agents' behaviours. A key step is treating safety and liveness separately, by synthesizing necessary safety and fairness assumptions and iteratively exchanging them in the form of advisers between the agents. We avoid the state-space explosion problem by computing advisers locally in each game, independently of the model and specification of other agents. The solution is sound, but conservative.

In this work, we propose a new mechanism for inferring hypothetical partners in tightly-coupled, heterogeneous systems called Dirichlet-Multinomial Counterfactual Selection (DMCS). Using DMCS, we show that agents can learn to infer appropriate counterfactual partners to receive more informative stepping stone rewards by testing in a modified multi-rover exploration problem. We also show that DMCS outperforms a random partner selection baseline by over 40%, and we demonstrate how domain knowledge can be used to induce a prior to guide the agent learning process. Finally, we show that DMCS maintains superior performance for up to 15 distinct rover types compared to the performance of the baseline which degrades rapidly.","","978-1-7281-2876-4","10.1109/MRS.2019.8901077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901077","","","learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems","homogeneous systems;agent-to-agent coupling requirements;hypothetical partners;heterogeneous systems;DMCS;multirover exploration problem;random partner selection baseline;agent learning process;heterogeneous multiagent systems;multirobot teams;tight coordination;team members;Dirichlet-multinomial counterfactual rewards;Dirichlet-multinomial counterfactual selection;multi-robot teams","","1","","29","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Important communication factors, such as latency and packet delivery ratio, are strong functions of the number of agents in the network. Findings from studies of mobile and high node-count radio-frequency (RF) mesh networks have only been transferred to the domain of multi-robot systems to a limited extent, and typical multi-agent robotic simulators often depend on simple propagation models that do not reflect the behavior of realistic RF networks. In this paper, we present a new open source swarm robotics simulator, BotNet, with an embedded standards-compliant time-synchronized channel hopping (6TiSCH) RF mesh network simulator. Using this simulator we show how more accurate communications models can limit even simple multi-robot control tasks such as flocking and formation control, with agent counts ranging from 10 up to 2500 agents. The experimental results are used to motivate changes to the inter-robot communication propagation models and other networking components currently used in practice in order to bridge the sim-to-real gap.","","978-1-6654-2926-9","10.1109/MRS50823.2021.9620611","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620611","","Radio frequency;Mesh networks;Wireless sensor networks;Botnet;Swarm robotics;Tools;Robot sensing systems","decentralised control;mobile robots;multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems","multiagent robotic simulators;simple propagation models;realistic RF networks;open source swarm robotics simulator;BotNet;embedded standards-compliant time;accurate communications models;simple multirobot control tasks;formation control;agent counts;inter-robot communication propagation models;networking components;accurate communication models;swarm control;decentralized control;multirobot systems;reliable communication;important communication factors;packet delivery ratio","","1","","46","IEEE","7 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, the agents are exposed to the risk of being attacked by malicious agents. Such situation, if not mitigated, risks the entire model and threatens its long-term performances. Due to uncertainties of an agent and its potential behavior, especially in human-agent collaboration systems, an agent might behave fraudulently to its partners (humans or agents). Therefore, security is a crucial aspect in the initial development of a collaborative human-agent system. However, many research envisages the security aspects only in the implementation stage. At this stage, a security model is strictly formulated based on the techniques and constraints among agents. Over the past decade, many researchers propose various security models with outstanding features. However, despite the features of the proposed security models, there is still a lack of research effort in security aspects for multi-agent systems, which is considered as a critical challenge. In this paper, we attempt to enhance the Generic Nodal Abstraction (GNA) approach with a security model applied among agents in their communication. The enhancements include authentication, message encryption and interaction constraints.","","978-1-5386-7856-5","10.1109/ISAMSR.2018.8540550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540550","Security;human agent collaboration;malicious agent","Multi-agent systems;Collaboration;Task analysis;Robots;Authentication;Organizations","cryptography;groupware;message authentication;multi-agent systems","collaborative human-agent system;multiagent systems;security enhancement;agents communication;GNA approach;malicious agents;human-agent collaboration systems;generic nodal abstraction approach;message encryption;interaction constraints;message authentication","","","","14","IEEE","22 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is due to the new research and industrial applications that they can cover. Assessing the performance and autonomous manoeuvring capability of the UA V in a dynamic and interactive indoor environment is challenging. To this end, this paper proposes a Performance Visualized Assessment (PV A) model to assess the performance quality of an autonomous UA V system in indoor environments. The PV A model includes Chi-square Inference (CSI) module and Visualized Mission Grid (VMG) map. The CSI has an optical flow indoor trajectory tracking and localization technique. It estimates the UA V flying positioning indoor without the GPS service. The VMG map has a visualized domain knowledge of the environment and the navigation mission scenario. The PVA model checks and visualizes the trajectory and the behaviour of the UA V when operating navigation missions. The PV A model is applied to track and assess the performance of a quadrotor UAV in real-time search missions. The results show the ability of the model to estimate and visualize the performance quality of the search missions with convenient accuracy. It narrows down the needed parameters of a critical assessment and reduces a human supervisor workload while monitoring the system's performance.","","978-1-5386-7856-5","10.1109/ISAMSR.2018.8540544","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540544","unmanned aerial vehicle;trajectory tracking technique;autonomous system;performance-based assessment","Drones;Trajectory tracking;Task analysis;Visualization;Navigation;Indoor environments","aircraft control;autonomous aerial vehicles;helicopters;indoor navigation;mobile robots;path planning;position control;remotely operated vehicles;robot vision;trajectory control","industrial applications;autonomous manoeuvring capability;dynamic environment;interactive indoor environment;Performance Visualized Assessment;performance quality;indoor environments;Chi-square Inference module;CSI;Visualized Mission Grid map;optical flow indoor trajectory tracking;localization technique;VMG map;visualized domain knowledge;PVA model checks;real-time search missions;critical assessment;real-time autonomous flight navigation trajectory assessment;unmanned aerial vehicles;indoor positioning;navigation mission;indoor local positioning techniques;autonomous UAV system;robotics system;trajectory visualization;quadrotor UAV","","5","","20","IEEE","22 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A recent research has produced SRL process mapping but the research was limited to producing a simulation video from historical data to prove the occurrence of SRL processes in online learning management system. This paper proposes to extend that research by adopting the concept of personal knowledge management (PKM) using the GUSC Model, to design an agent-based SRL simulation. This would enable real-time data to be analysed as and when it is needed for prediction of SRL activities. The design of the multi-agent system is possible with the availability of data and knowledge on how these data could be interpreted by the software agents to present an SRL process in both graphical and text report forms. This paper presents the process of analysing students' online SRL behaviour throughout a semester, taking into account a technical course as the benchmark case study, and designing the agent- based simulation for lecturers' prediction on students' online SRL behaviour. In order to do so, simulation video from the recent work is analysed to capture moment-to-moment SRL processes. The purpose of this analysis is mainly to facilitate the understanding of how software agents could be animated step by step. The results from this study is expected to be beneficial to the stakeholders of online education system. Future work will be on developing the agent-based simulation of SRL.","","978-1-5386-7856-5","10.1109/ISAMSR.2018.8540556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540556","self-regulated learning;software agent;GUSC Model;simulation","Software agents;Analytical models;Task analysis;Multi-agent systems;Data models;Predictive models;Education","data analysis;distance learning;educational courses;further education;Internet;learning management systems;multi-agent systems;software agents","multiagent system;software agents;graphical text report forms;lecturers;simulation video;online education system;agent-based simulation;GUSC Model;university students;SRL process mapping;online learning management system;personal knowledge management;agent-based self-regulated learning simulation;agent-based SRL simulation;student online SRL behaviour analysis;technical course","","1","","20","IEEE","22 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The testbed is composed of an off-the-shelf rolling weaselball toy and a 3D printed external hub that modifies the agent's dynamics. The software toolbox includes simulations and code for data extraction and analysis of the weaselballs. The advantage of our testbed for studying distributed robotic systems is that these robots can be made quickly and cheaply, are relatively small, and do not require complex or expensive environments. The software in our toolbox includes a high fidelity Gazebo simulation, and Python code for analyzing trajectories from both simulation and overhead video of the system.

The process of calibration is done by tracking the user's attention at 5 and 9 points of calibration process using a webcam. The circle detection of iris is used to determine the eye center coordinates. In this paper, the eye center coordinates are being extracted by using the well-known face detection algorithm which is Viola-Jones algorithm.

Although Prometheus and TDF are introduced to model BDI agent, the modelling and simulating BDI agent is not a straightforward process. As simulation is one of the pillars in IR4.0, it is undoubtedly that there will be a higher demand and usage of agent simulation in real world problem.

The finite state machine is a common technique used in developing AI in games, using a predetermined action for each situation. The problem with a predetermined action is that the scripted behaviours are predictable and easily exploit by human players. Such settings cause the game to have repetitive gameplay, leading the player to lose interest since the player knows how the AI will behave. The primary approach of this project is to use reinforcement learning to train the agent for the game. Reinforcement learning algorithms learn what to do and map the situations to maximize the cumulative reward signal from the agent environment. The agent in this project will receive raw data from the environment as input, and the agent will then act based on the environment rather than predetermined action. The results show that lowering the learning rate in deep reinforcement learning can increase the cumulative reward for the agent. This project's findings will be helpful for the game developers in developing AI for their games and benefit the game players who will interact with the AI in those games.","","978-1-6654-3632-8","10.1109/ISAMSR53229.2021.9567749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567749","Artificial Intelligence;Reinforcement Learning;Fighting Game;Unity ML-Agent","Three-dimensional displays;Virtual environments;Games;Reinforcement learning;Prediction algorithms;C# languages;Artificial intelligence","computer games;deep learning (artificial intelligence);finite state machines;multi-agent systems","AI bot;virtual environment;finite state machine;human players;agent environment;learning rate;deep reinforcement learning;game developers;game players;video game fighting;cumulative reward signal","","1","","13","IEEE","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Studies of recent years uncovered drawbacks of domain-specific simulation models for dynamic processes which include unreliable simulation results and questionable robustness of simulation model. Generic agent-based simulation modelling frameworks tried to bridge the gap being a platform to simulate different domain-specific simulation models. However, the efforts were not continued, most probably due to the main gap of having domain-specific models developed for each specific simulation objectives were not addressed. Thus, the aim of this research to bridge the gap by having a self-adaptive simulation model. Dynamic processes from three different domains. For instance, transportation, education and security were used as benchmark of self-capability of the simulation model. Key parameters, self-adaptive algorithms were formulated and implemented through simulation model. The self-adaptive simulation model was able to construct simulation model and generate replicable results based on different combinations of key parameter inputs entered into the simulation system.

Shortage of resources to curb the spread that is caused by stubborn self-quarantined individuals added to the pain. This paper presents a conceptual framework for agent-mediated self-quarantine monitoring to lessen the burden of the health officers. This framework consists of four main software agents performing tasks from data capture in sensor device to the analysis and transmission of alerts to health officers and appointed recipients. The name RADT framework is given for the main tasks the agents are assigned with, namely Retrieve, Analyse, Decide and Transmit. In general, the software agents perform their tasks in their environment, with the capabilities deemed possible at their level. As their services are required for only 14 days according to the self-quarantine procedure, the agents are programmed to self-terminate after that.","","978-1-6654-3632-8","10.1109/ISAMSR53229.2021.9567828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567828","software agents;personal knowledge management;multi-agent system;self-quarantine monitoring","COVID-19;Performance evaluation;Industries;Pandemics;Pain;Robot sensing systems;Software agents","diseases;multi-agent systems;patient monitoring;software agents","pandemic crisis;public places;COVID-19 virus;health industry;agent-mediated self-quarantine monitoring;health officers;main software agents;name RADT framework","","1","","25","IEEE","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among them, 8 sociotechnical systems were developed using the JADE prototyping guidelines together with JADE website resources, while the remaining 8 sociotechnical systems where developed using JADE website resources alone. The evaluation results of the JADE prototyping guidelines ascertain that they are more effective for the development of agent knowledge of sociotechnical systems in JADE framework than the current practice of using JADE website resources alone. Moreover, the evaluation results of the JADE prototyping guidelines find out that conceptual objects of sociotechnical systems are necessary building blocks in developing JADE ontology. In the future work, we will conduct another empirical study with a large sample size of professionals that aims to increase the confidence in the results obtained from this empirical study.","","978-1-5386-7856-5","10.1109/ISAMSR.2018.8540558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540558","empirical evaluation;agent-oriented modelling;sociotechnical systems","Guidelines;Sociotechnical systems;Tools;Software;Adaptation models;Prototypes;Ontologies","human computer interaction;Java;multi-agent systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);software agents;software development management;software prototyping","JADE framework;conceptual modelling;Java Agent Development framework;JADE knowledge;behaviour prototyping guidelines;JADE prototyping guidelines;JADE website resources;JADE ontology;empirical evaluation;prototyping sociotechnical systems;sociotechnical systems","","","","34","IEEE","22 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main motivator for this interest is the fact that the deployment of multiple vehicles reduces the risk of mission failures and provides higher performance and flexibility through parallelism [3]. Among the main subproblems of cooperative control, formation control is usually an essential component and Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a promising tool to carry out this task deliberately. Since MPC is architecturally flexible and handles the performance and constraints systematically in parallel, it is drawing more attention nowadays [4]. Among MPC methods, especially Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is particularly suitable to control the robots whose fast dynamics are needed to be predicted by nonlinear models and constraints as in multirotor MAVs. Additionally, for large scale systems, Decentralized NMPC (D-NMPC) strategies are advantageous since they address the computational complexity by dividing the overall optimization problem into decoupled subproblems and by reducing communication requirements [4]. Furthermore, in order to deploy highly autonomous multi-rotor MAVs in non-trivial environments, several researchers focus on elaborating local and relative sensing in formation control and try to solve its limitations [5].","","978-1-7281-2876-4","10.1109/MRS.2019.8901098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901098","Formation control;Decentralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC);Multirotor Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs);Pose-Graph Moving Horizon Estimation (PG-MHE)","Robot sensing systems;Predictive control;Vehicle dynamics;Three-dimensional displays;Estimation","autonomous aerial vehicles;collision avoidance;decentralised control;large-scale systems;microrobots;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;nonlinear control systems;predictive control;remotely operated vehicles;vehicles","3D formation;multirotor microaerial vehicles;relative sensing;cooperation strategies;high-level missions;intelligence gathering etc;multiple vehicles;mission failures;formation control;MPC methods;nonlinear models;highly autonomous multirotor MAV;decentralized NMPC;decentralized nonlinear model predictive control;D-NMPC","","5","","23","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applying a fuzzy logic rule makes it easier to get a cleaner cloth compared to the traditional method of manually adjusting the output parameters. In addition, applying fuzzy logic saves the amount of water, detergent and electricity, and finally saves time, which is a big factor, reducing process costs. This project aims to design and implement a washing marching system. As well as to study the effect of applying fuzzy logic rules in enhancing washing machine control system.

In Central Place Foraging (CPF), robots search for dispersed resources from a foraging arena and consolidate them in a centrally-placed collection zone [1]-[3]. Two major problems limit the scalability of CPF. First, larger swarms produce more inter-robot collisions. Second, large foraging arenas require that robots travel further distances to find resources and transport them which leads to “diminishing returns” [4]. The Multiple Place Foraging Algorithm (MPFA) [5]-[7] improves scalability using multiple collection zones dispersed in a foraging arena. However, it still has diminishing returns when the arena size is very large. Here we propose the bio-inspired hierarchical branching transportation network (MPFAT) based on resource transportation networks in plants and animals. We derive scaling relationships for a 2D foraging area (rather than a 3D animal volume). We use this scaling law to predict the transportation infrastructure required to maintain constant per-robot foraging rate with increasing swarm and arena size.","","978-1-7281-2876-4","10.1109/MRS.2019.8901050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901050","","Transportation;Robot kinematics;Scalability;Animals;Particle swarm optimization;Task analysis","collision avoidance;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;transportation","bio-inspired hierarchical branching transportation network;resource transportation networks;2D foraging area;bio-inspired transportation network;central place foraging;CPF;robots search;inter-robot collisions;scalable swarm foraging;multiple place foraging algorithm;MPFA;diminishing returns","","","1","15","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A local trajectory for each robot is then computed by introducing these chance constraints in a receding horizon model predictive controller.

The work builds upon the previously proposed Buffered Voronoi Cell (BVC) approach. We introduce a probabilistic formulation to construct a family of BVCs with specified safety levels, which take into account uncertainty in sensor measurements among the robots. The safety level of a PBVC represents the probability that the area is contained inside the robot's true (but unknown) BVC. The PBVC provides a set of probabilistically safe positions for the robot to navigate to. Each agent chooses its next position constrained within the PBVC of a desired safety level, while minimizing the deviation from its reference trajectory. We prove a conservative bound on the probability of collision given this reciprocal strategy. We also validate through simulations that the proposed approach achieves safe navigation among multiple robots in challenging scenarios, and provides a significantly lower risk of collision than either the Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO) method or the Buffered Voronoi Cell (BVC) method when the robots use noisy relative measurements. We also show in experiments with small-scale robotic cars that the algorithm is fast, effective and is useful in real applications.","","978-1-7281-2876-4","10.1109/MRS.2019.8901101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901101","","Collision avoidance;Robot sensing systems;Safety;Probabilistic logic;Uncertainty;Navigation","collision avoidance;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;probability","distributed collision avoidance;multiple robots;PBVC;BVC;probabilistic formulation;safety levels;noisy relative measurements;small-scale robotic cars;buffered Voronoi cell method;safe positions;probabilistic buffered Voronoi cells;reciprocal velocity obstacles","","12","","25","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This has motivated many efforts on optimizing manipulation tasks involving a single arm. Coordinating multiple arms for manipulation, however, introduces additional computational challenges arising from the increased DoFS, as well as the combinatorial increase in the available operations that many manipulators can perform, including handoffs between arms. The focus here is on pick-and-place tasks, which require a sequence of handoffs to be executed, so as to achieve computational efficiency, asymptotic optimality and practical anytime performance. The paper leverages recent advances in multi-robot motion planning for high DoF systems to propose a novel multi-modal extension of the dRRT* algorithm. The key insight is that, instead of naively solving a sequence of motion planning problems, it is computationally advantageous to directly explore the composite space of the integrated multi-arm task and motion planning problem, given input sets of possible pick and handoff configurations. A proof sketch regarding the asymptotic optimality of the method is included in this work given the sampling of additional picks and handoffs over time. The evaluation shows that the approach finds initial solutions fast and improves their quality over time. It also succeeds in finding solutions to harder problem instances relative to alternatives and can scale effectively as the number of robots increases.","","978-1-7281-2876-4","10.1109/MRS.2019.8901083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901083","","Manipulators;Task analysis;Planning;Robot kinematics;Tensors;Search problems","combinatorial mathematics;computational complexity;manipulators;multi-robot systems;optimisation;path planning","automation applications;manufacturing environments;manipulation tasks;single arm;combinatorial increase;pick-and-place tasks;computational efficiency;asymptotic optimality;multi-robot motion planning;motion planning problem;handoff configurations;DoF manipulators;multi-arm task;dRRT algorithm;integrated multi-arm task;warehouse environments","","12","","42","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such a by design simple mobile robot is for example the differential-drive mobile robot which has already established itself in many everyday tasks. However since its dynamics is subject to a non-holonomic constraint the optimal control of even a single robot is not a trivial task. In particular model predictive control with standard quadratic stage costs does not necessarily lead to an asymptotically stable closed loop. For this reason the present article aims to develop a theoretically-founded distributed formation controller for differentially-driven mobile robots which is substantiated in real-life experiments. Moreover the gained insights are transferred to other non-holonomic systems. Notably it is conjectured how a kinematic car could be regulated based on the aforementioned findings","","978-1-6654-2926-9","10.1109/MRS50823.2021.9620683","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:433183605); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620683","","Wireless communication;Costs;Optimal control;Kinematics;Stability analysis;Mobile robots;Automobiles","asymptotic stability;closed loop systems;distributed control;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;optimal control;predictive control","standard quadratic stage costs;asymptotically stable closed loop;formation controller;differentially-driven mobile robots;nonholonomic systems;distributed model predictive formation control;nonholonomic robotic agents;ongoing advancements;wireless communication;cost-efficient embedded computing units;simple robots;highly complex robot;design simple mobile robot;differential-drive mobile robot;nonholonomic constraint;optimal control;particular model predictive control","","10","","42","IEEE","7 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But, as these types of systems will increase in the future years, an efficient way of communication is necessary. To this aim, it is interesting to discover if a multi-robot system can communicate its intentions exploiting only some motion-variables, which are characteristics of the motion of the robots. This study is about the legibility of a multi-robot system: in particular, we focus on the influence of these motion-variables on the legibility of more than one group of robots that move in a shared environment with the user. These motion-variables are: trajectory, dispersion and stiffness. They are generally used to define the motion of a group of mobile robots. Trajectory and dispersion were found relevant for the correctness of the communication between the user and the multi-robot system, while stiffness was found relevant for the rapidity of communication. The analysis of the influence of the motion-variables was carried out with an ANOVA (analysis of variance) based on a series of data coming from an experimental campaign conducted in a virtual reality set-up.","","978-1-7281-2876-4","10.1109/MRS.2019.8901100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901100","","Multi-robot systems;Mobile robots;Trajectory;Virtual reality;Complexity theory;Collision avoidance","control engineering computing;elasticity;mobile robots;motion control;multi-robot systems;statistical analysis;virtual reality","multirobot system;motion-variables;shared environment;mobile robots;stiffness;ANOVA;analysis of variance;virtual reality set-up","","8","","18","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The MAV formation is optimal in the sense that the vehicles minimize the detection error in their collective decision-making.

This constraint is then included in an optimization problem, whose objective is that of modifying, in a minimally invasive fashion, the nominal input to the robots. The formulated optimization problem is decentralized in the sense that, in order to be solved, it does not require the individual robots to have access to global information.

It is, however, challenging for swarm algorithms to offer scalability and efficiency, while preserving mathematical insights into the exhibited behavior. A new decentralized search method (called Bayes-Swarm), founded on batch Bayesian Optimization (BO) principles, is presented here to address these challenges. Unlike swarm heuristics approaches, Bayes-Swarm decouples the knowledge generation and task planning process, thus preserving insights into the emergent behavior. Key contributions lie in: 1) modeling knowledge extraction over trajectories, unlike in BO; 2) time-adaptively balancing exploration/exploitation and using an efficient local penalization approach to account for potential interactions among different robots' planned samples; and 3) presenting an asynchronous implementation of the algorithm. This algorithm is tested on case studies with bimodal and highly multimodal signal distributions. Up to 76 times better efficiency is demonstrated compared to an exhaustive search baseline. The benefits of exploitation/exploration balancing, asynchronous planning, and local penalization, and scalability with swarm size, are also demonstrated.","","978-1-7281-2876-4","10.1109/MRS.2019.8901084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901084","Swarm Robotic Search;Informative Path Planning;Bayesian Search;Gaussian Process;Asynchronous","Robots;Swarm robotics;Task analysis;Planning;Optimization;Path planning;Bayes methods","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;multi-robot systems;particle swarm optimisation;path planning;search problems","informative path planning;asynchronous swarm robotic search;decentralized swarm robotic solutions;spatially varying signal promise task parallelism;fault tolerance;swarm algorithms;mathematical insights;exhibited behavior;decentralized search method;batch Bayesian Optimization principles;BO;swarm heuristics approaches;Bayes-Swarm decouples;knowledge generation;task planning process;asynchronous implementation;bimodal signal distributions;highly multimodal signal distributions;exhaustive search baseline;asynchronous planning;swarm size;local penalization approach","","6","","33","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our system achieves scalability in the number of AUVs by using one-way travel time for ranging and making the AUVs passive receivers. Further, it allows the ASVs to be repositioned during a mission, so that they can provide positioning aid from a closer range.

The robotic network needs to adapt self-reliantly to different scenarios. Similarly, robustness advantages can be put into practice only if robots can join and leave the robotic network at any time. In that regard, cooperative object transportation constitutes an appropriate model problem to study whether a cooperation scheme is fit to realize the potential of distributed robotics. This paper proposes an optimization-driven scheme for the transportation of, potentially non-convex, polygonal objects which shall be pushed by a group of omnidirectional mobile robots. For dynamic control, distributed model predictive control is used, whereas a custom distributed optimization algorithm is proposed to deal with organization. The latter algorithm is, essentially, a distributed version of augmented Lagrangian particle swarm optimization. Experiments with purpose-built robots show that the scheme can deal with different scenarios without scenario-specific parameter tuning as well as with robots joining and leaving, realizing the promises of cooperative robotics.","","978-1-6654-2926-9","10.1109/MRS50823.2021.9620541","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG German Research Foundation)(grant numbers:433183605); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620541","","Heuristic algorithms;Transportation;Organizations;Prediction algorithms;Robustness;Task analysis;Particle swarm optimization","distributed control;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;particle swarm optimisation;predictive control","object transportation;omnidirectional mobile robots;distributed robotics;robotic automation;distributed model predictive control;custom distributed optimization algorithm;augmented Lagrangian particle swarm optimization;purpose-built robots;cooperative robotics","","4","","51","IEEE","7 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent work in automated approaches to learning swarm behavior has been limited to individual primitives with sparse work on learning complete missions. This paper presents a systematic approach to learn tactical mission-specific policies that compose primitives in a swarm to accomplish the mission efficiently using neural networks with special input and output encoding. To learn swarm tactics in an adversarial environment, we employ a combination of 1) map-to-graph abstraction, 2) input/output encoding via Pareto filtering of points of interest and clustering of robots, and 3) learning via neuroevolution and policy gradient approaches. We illustrate this combination as critical to providing tractable learning, especially given the computational cost of simulating swarm missions of this scale and complexity. Successful mission completion outcomes are demonstrated with up to 60 robots.

A robust multi-robot exploration strategy with communication constraints is important to accomplish several applications, e.g., underwater or planetary exploration. Mainstream multi-robot exploration strategies have considered unlimited communication. In addition, these strategies delegate the resolution of potential path collisions to local planners. In this paper, we explicitly focus on minimizing the number of communication events between robots given the limited bandwidth that can be available in real missions, as well as explicitly minimizing potential path interference between robots. GVGExp incrementally builds a Generalized Voronoi Graph (GVG), which is used by the robots to determine the topology of the environment. We introduce a novel property of the GVG called gate to identify a region (subtree) that is uniquely assigned to each robot, with no overlap, thus minimizing potential path interference. Whenever a robot finishes exploring a region, in a depth-first search fashion, or finds a loop connecting to other parts of the environment, the robot shares information with other robots that are in range to enable coordination. We performed numerous simulations to evaluate our proposed strategy and compared it with other state-of-the-art methods.

The continuous operation in these applications is challenged by limited onboard battery capacity of the persistent robots. We consider the problem for replenishing persistent robots using mobile depots, where mobile depots collectively compute a set of tours to drop off batteries for replenishing all persistent robots with the minimum total cost. Compared to other works, persistent robots are not required to detour for recharging or battery swapping. We formulate this problem as generalized multiple depots traveling salesman problem (GMDTSP) on a complete graph. An efficient centralized heuristic-based algorithm Multiple Depots Random Select (MDRS) is proposed, which has been proved to have an analytical constant upper bound in the worst case scenario. To provide scalability and robustness, a fully decentralized asynchronous MDRS (dec-MDRS) is proposed, with the analysis of its correctness and efficiency. We also propose a post-processing heuristic (MDRS-IM) to improve the solution quality. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm via benchmark on multiple instances from TSPLIB and GTSPLIB. The simulation results show that the complexity of dec-MDRS grows linearly as the number of robots increases. The simulation also shows that MDRS and MDRS-IM perform significantly faster than the state of the art heuristic solver LKH with only a loss of about 10% of solution quality.","","978-1-7281-2876-4","10.1109/MRS.2019.8901096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901096","","Robots;Batteries;Planning;Surveillance;Heuristic algorithms;Upper bound","mobile robots;multi-robot systems;path planning;travelling salesman problems","persistent surveillance;multiple robots;persistent robots;generalized multiple depots;algorithm Multiple Depots Random Select;fully decentralized asynchronous MDRS;dec-MDRS;MDRS-IM;decentralized multiple mobile depots route planning;generalized multiple depots traveling salesman problem;GTSPLIB;TSPLIB","","3","","22","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most same-day deliveries are operated using a single depot and with vehicles' routes planned and fixed when leaving the depot. In this paper, we relax these two assumptions and focus on on-demand grocery delivery using a fleet of autonomous vehicles or robots. The problem features the opportunity to pick up goods at multiple local stores or depots, for example, supermarkets within the city, and allows robots to perform depot returns prior to being empty, if beneficial. This allows for more agile planning and on average shorter distance to the next depot. We propose a novel dynamic method for the same-day delivery problem, where we aim to deliver orders as fast as possible, minimally within the same day. In each time step (every few seconds or minutes) the following is executed: For each order potential pick-up locations are identified and feasible trips, i.e., sequences to pick up goods and deliver orders, are calculated. To assign trips to robots an integer-linear program is solved. We simulate one day of service in a city under different conditions with up to 30 autonomous robots, 30 depots and 10,500 orders. Results underpin the advantages of the proposed method and show its versatility with respect to different situations.","","978-1-6654-2926-9","10.1109/MRS50823.2021.9620599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620599","","Sensitivity;Urban areas;Robot sensing systems;Planning;Delays;Vehicle dynamics;Robots","goods distribution;integer programming;mobile robots;vehicle routing","single depot;on-demand grocery delivery;autonomous vehicles;multiple local stores;depot returns;same-day delivery problem;order potential pick-up locations;autonomous delivery robots;integer-linear program","","3","","26","EU","7 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem's innovation is in the combination of two aspects: first, the existence of adversarial forces that may intentionally act to divert the robots from a desired consensus, and an asymmetry of state transition, that is, a robot may have a stronger tendency to change from one state to another, compared to the other way around. We provide a theoretical analysis of formation creation as a mean to guarantee consensus, and an empirical evaluation-both in simulation and in real robots-demonstrating the influence of different robot behaviors and internal factors on the convergence time and value.","","978-1-7281-2876-4","10.1109/MRS.2019.8901090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901090","","Robot sensing systems;Robot kinematics;Contamination;Swarm robotics;Resistance;Switches","mobile robots;multi-robot systems","robotic swarm contamination problem;consensus problem;state transition;robot behaviors;internal factors;external factors;adversarial forces;convergence time;formation creation","","2","","22","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We wish to understand how can an adversarial observer reverse-engineer the tasks being performed by a team of robots by simply observing their positions. To address this question, we use the concept of persistency of excitation from system identification. Each robot in the team uses optimization-based controllers for mediating between task satisfaction and collision avoidance. These controllers exhibit an implicit dependence on the task's parameters which poses a hurdle for deriving necessary conditions for parameter identification, since such conditions usually require an explicit relation. We address this bottleneck by using duality theory and SVD of active collision avoidance constraints and derive an explicit relation between each robot's task parameters and its control inputs. This allows us to derive the main necessary conditions for successful identification which agree with our intuition. We demonstrate the importance of these conditions through numerical simulations by using (a) an adaptive observer and (b) an unscented Kalman filter for goal and gain estimation in various geometric settings. These simulations show that under circumstances where parameter inference is supposed to be infeasible per our conditions, both these estimators fail, and likewise when it is feasible, both converge to the true parameters.

Our approach does not require each robot to share its torques, objective functions, and local constraints with other robots.

In this paper, we focus on collective estimation as an example of collective decision-making. The task is to estimate the average scalar intensity of a desired feature in the environment. The solution we propose consists of exploration and exploitation phases, where the switching time is a factor dictating the balance between the two phases. By decomposing the total accuracy into bias and variance, we explain that diversity and social interactions could promote accuracy of the collective decision. We also show how the exploration-vs-exploitation tradeoff relates to the speed-vs-accuracy tradeoff. One significant finding of our work is that there is an optimal duration for exploration to compromise between speed and accuracy. This duration cannot be determined offline for an unknown environment. Hence, we propose an adaptive, distributed mechanism enabling individual agents to decide in a decentralized manner when to switch. Moreover, the spatial consequence of the exploitation phase is an emergent collective movement, leading to the aggregation of the collective at the iso-contours of the mean intensity of the environmental field in the spatial domain. Examples of potential applications for such a fully distributed collective estimation model are spillage capturing and source localization.","","978-1-6654-2926-9","10.1109/MRS50823.2021.9620695","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620695","","Location awareness;Systematics;Phase measurement;Decision making;Estimation;Switches;Control systems","decision making","speed-vs-accuracy tradeoff;adaptive exploration-exploitation case;collective decision-making;average scalar intensity;adaptive distributed mechanism;emergent collective movement;fully distributed collective estimation model;exploration-vs-exploitation tradeoff","","1","","36","IEEE","7 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accordingly, we use two stages to compare different maps and match them together based on their mutual resemblance. Our method is complemented by a scoring system to measure the likelihood that two vertices in different OTSMs correspond to the same vertex, despite possible errors in labeling, orientation, or topological structure.

Alongside smog, road safety also needs to be considered. For instance, in 2015, over 26,000 people died and nearly 1.5 million people were injured on the roads [1] across the European Union. Therefore, it should be noted that human error has been identified as a contributing factor in over 90% of all road accidents.
