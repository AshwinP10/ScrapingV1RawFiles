Hernández,2023,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10160603,NO,"Our framework consists of 3 modules: 1) world modeling that incorporates a novel Social Heatmap (SH) to represent crowded areas, 2) multilayered path planning that uses sampling-based approaches, and 3) path following control. We extensively benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art approaches in challenging simulated scenarios, and $w$ e also demonstrate its feasibility with the Pepper robot in real-world trials."
Unfreezing Social Navigation: Dynamical Systems based Compliance for Contact Control in Robot Navigation,D. Paez-Granados; V. Gupta; A. Billard,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9811772,NO,Mitigating the risk of collision is done by modulating the velocity commands upon detecting a contact and by absorbing part of the contact force through active compliant control when the robot bumps inad-vertently against a pedestrian. We present a force-limited and obstacle avoidance controller integrated into a time-invariant dynamical system (DS) in a closed-loop force controller that let the robot react instantaneously to contact or to the sudden appearance of pedestrians.
Towards Safe Navigation Through Crowded Dynamic Environments,Z. Xie; P. Xin; P.

This paper proposes a novel neural network-based control policy to enable a mobile robot to navigate safety through environments filled with both static obstacles, such as tables and chairs, and dense crowds of pedestrians."
Cooperative Range-only SLAM based on Sum of Gaussian Filter in Dynamic Environments,J. -H. Kim; D. Kim,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8967646,NO,"To address the aforementioned issues, a cooperative dynamic RO-SLAM (CDRO-SLAM) is proposed in this paper, which is a RO-SLAM algorithm based on sum of Gaussian (SoG) filter with cooperative measurements in dynamic environments. Most range-only simultaneous localization and mapping (RO-SLAM) algorithms have considered direct measurements between robot and its neighbor nodes only, even though other inter-node measurements can be actively used to improve the performance."

Aufrère,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636804,NO,"While navigating in complex urban environments, the Bayesian occupancy grid is one of the most popular types of maps, where the information of occupancy is stored as the probability of collision. Although widely used, this kind of representation is not well suited for risk assessment: because of its discrete nature, the probability of collision becomes dependent on the tessellation size."

Alahi,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8794134,NO,"We propose to (i) rethink pairwise interactions with a self-attention mechanism, and (ii) jointly model Human-Robot as well as Human-Human interactions in the deep reinforcement learning framework. However, their cooperation ability deteriorates as the crowd grows since they typically relax the problem as a one-way Human-Robot interaction problem."

Simonin,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9340892,NO,"Current Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) algorithms focus on finding a path for the robot that only optimizes the displacement cost of navigating and moving obstacles out of its way.

Riek,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9561897,NO,"However, due to EDs being overcrowded, and the cognitive overload HCWs experience, robots need to understand various levels of patient acuity so they avoid disrupting care delivery. SafeDQN is based on two insights about care in EDs: high-acuity patients tend to have more HCWs in attendance and those HCWs tend to move more quickly."

SocialGym: A Framework for Benchmarking Social Robot Navigation,J. Holtz; J. Biswas,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9982021,NO,"A framework for these benchmarks would need to support a wide variety of learning approaches, be extensible to the broad range of social navigation scenarios, and abstract away the perception problem to focus on social navigation explicitly. Further, we present benchmark results that compare and contrast human-engineered and model-based learning approaches to a suite of off-the-shelf Learning from Demonstration (LfD) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches applied to social robot navigation."

We improve the sample-efficiency over previous IRL-based methods by introducing a shared experience replay buffer that allows reuse of past trajectory experiences to estimate the policy and the reward.

Stone,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9561286,NO,"The results also indicate that gaze both precedes head orientation and can be used to predict the goal of a person’s walking motion at a higher level of accuracy earlier in their walking trajectory. Gaze is believed to generally precede head orientation, with a person quickly moving their eyes to a target and then following it with a turn of their head."

Thereby, developing an acceptable behavior for autonomous robots in the area mentioned above is a foreseeable problem for the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) field."
Iterative Program Synthesis for Adaptable Social Navigation,J. Holtz; S. Andrews; A. Guha; J. Biswas,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636540,NO,"While effective, these approaches have fundamental limitations – model-based approaches require constraint and parameter tuning to adapt to preferences and new scenarios, while learning-based approaches require reward functions, significant training data, and are hard to adapt to new social scenarios or new domains with limited demonstrations.In this work, we propose Iterative Dimension Informed Program Synthesis (IDIPS) to address these limitations by learning and adapting social navigation in the form of human-readable symbolic programs. We introduce a novel predicate repair technique that can accommodate previously unseen social scenarios or preferences by growing existing policies.We present experimental results showing that IDIPS: 1) synthesizes effective policies that model user preference, 2) can adapt existing policies to changing preferences, 3) can extend policies to handle novel social scenarios such as locked doors, and 4) generates policies that can be transferred from simulation to real-world robots with minimal effort."

Zhao,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9340876,NO,"Reinforcement learning-based methods usually suffer performance degradation on long-horizon tasks with goal-conditioned sparse rewards, so we decompose the long-range navigation task into many easier sub-tasks under the guidance of a global planner, which increases agents' performance in large environments. Experiments show that MAPPER is able to achieve higher success rates and more stable performance when exposed to a large number of non-cooperative dynamic obstacles compared with traditional reaction-based planner LRA* and the state-of-the-art learning-based method."

Yonetani,2020,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9341519,NO,"Our proposed Learning to Balance (L2B) framework enables mobile robot agents to steer safely towards their destinations by avoiding collisions with a crowd, while actively clearing a path by asking nearby pedestrians to make room, if necessary, to keep their travel efficient. With this observation, our L2B framework augments the reward function used in learning an interactive navigation policy to penalize frequent active path clearing and passive collision avoidance, which substantially improves the balance of the safety-efficiency trade-off."
