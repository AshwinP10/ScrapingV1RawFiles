Beltrame,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901059,NO,"We propose a novel formulation of the collision-aware task assignment (CATA) problem and a decentralized auction-based algorithm to solve the problem with optimality bound. We validate the improved task assignment solution with both simulation and experimental results, which show significant reduction of overlapping paths as well as deadlocks."
On-Demand Grocery Delivery From Multiple Local Stores With Autonomous Robots,M. Kronmueller; A. Fielbaum; J. Alonso-Mora,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620599,NO,"In each time step (every few seconds or minutes) the following is executed: For each order potential pick-up locations are identified and feasible trips, i.e., sequences to pick up goods and deliver orders, are calculated. The problem features the opportunity to pick up goods at multiple local stores or depots, for example, supermarkets within the city, and allows robots to perform depot returns prior to being empty, if beneficial."
Multi-robot Learning and Coverage of Unknown Spatial Fields,M. Santos; U. Madhushani; A. Benevento; N. E. Leonard,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620688,NO,The proposed algorithm leads the team of robots to an optimal solution of the coverage problem by efficiently trading off movement choices for learning the field with movement choices for covering the estimated field. This paper addresses the problem of optimally covering a domain when the scalar function that describes the relative importance of the points in the domain is initially unknown.
The Robotic Swarm Contamination Problem,S. Avrahami; N. Agmon,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901090,NO,"The problem's innovation is in the combination of two aspects: first, the existence of adversarial forces that may intentionally act to divert the robots from a desired consensus, and an asymmetry of state transition, that is, a robot may have a stronger tendency to change from one state to another, compared to the other way around. In this paper we introduce the contamination problem, a new version of the consensus problem in which the robots' influence to adopt a certain value towards a consensus is based on both external factors (its surroundings) and its internal state."
IoT-Based Contactless Body Temperature Scanning System for a Smart and Safe Campus,T. C. Onn; N. A. M. Alduais; J. Abdullah; A. -M. H. Y. Saad; A. A. Ramli; H. B. Mahdin; S. Kasim; A. Mustapha; S. A. Mostafa; M. S. Jawad; W. A. H. M. Ghanem; A. S. H. Abdul-Qawy,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567862,NO,"The software and hardware used in this study were Microsoft Visual Studio, ThingSpeak, Arduino IDE, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and contactless body temperature sensor. Nowadays, everyone is required to check the body temperature and record personal details whenever he arrives at a different place."
Parameter Identification for Multirobot Systems Using Optimization-based Controllers,J. Grover; C. Liu; K. Sycara,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620566,NO,"These simulations show that under circumstances where parameter inference is supposed to be infeasible per our conditions, both these estimators fail, and likewise when it is feasible, both converge to the true parameters. We demonstrate the importance of these conditions through numerical simulations by using (a) an adaptive observer and (b) an unscented Kalman filter for goal and gain estimation in various geometric settings."
Online Decentralized Perception-Aware Path Planning for Multi-Robot Systems,N. De Carli; P. Salaris; P. R. Giordano,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620694,NO,"The aim is to maximize the information collected along the planned trajectory about the relative configurations of the robots and, hence, to minimize the localization uncertainty. To show the effectiveness of the approach, we consider as case study the localization of a quadrotor group with noisy distance measurements and sensing constraints."
Distributed Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization for Collaborative Manipulation,O. Shorinwa; M. Schwager,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620665,NO,"While the global collaborative manipulation problem consists of multiple sets of non-smooth contact dynamics constraints for all robots, each robot in our method considers only its own contact dynamics constraints without those of other robots in its trajectory optimization problem, enabling each robot to efficiently compute its forces and torques. We demonstrate our method in the manipulation of a sliding rod along a surface with friction, as well as in the manipulation of an object falling under gravity by a group of quadrotors."
Speed-vs-Accuracy Tradeoff in Collective Estimation: An Adaptive Exploration-Exploitation Case,M. Raoufi; H. Hamann; P. Romanczuk,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620695,NO,"Moreover, the spatial consequence of the exploitation phase is an emergent collective movement, leading to the aggregation of the collective at the iso-contours of the mean intensity of the environmental field in the spatial domain. The solution we propose consists of exploration and exploitation phases, where the switching time is a factor dictating the balance between the two phases."
Map Merging of Oriented Topological Semantic Maps,J. L. S. Rincon; S. Carpin,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901093,NO,"Our method is complemented by a scoring system to measure the likelihood that two vertices in different OTSMs correspond to the same vertex, despite possible errors in labeling, orientation, or topological structure. This problem arises when a group of robots cooperatively explore an environment, and each one independently builds a partial map that must be combined with the others into a full map."
Comparative Analysis of Sensors in Rigid and Deformable Modular Robots for Shape Estimation,S. Ceron; N. Wilson; L. Horowitz; K. Petersen,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8901072,NO,"Modular self-reconfigurable robots have the ability to change their connection topology to form large networks of distributed sensors and actuators, for example to reason about gradients in the environment or the geometry of their surroundings. Specifically, we compare the use of connectivity and IR sensors which are commonly available on modules, and demonstrate what may be gained from deformable modules with integrated strain sensors."
Industrial Digital Twins Powered by Artificial Intelligence Solutions for Enhanced Product Life-Cycle Development,M. Hlayel; M. S. Jawad; H. Mahdin; S. A. Mostafa; N. A. Mohammed Alduais; M. H. Abd Wahab,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567884,NO,Automated product life-cycle development that can be achieved by digital-twin and AI solutions is of a high concern recently both in academia and industry and it is highly expected to witness a raid growth in the coming few years. This allows organizations to clearly understand the contributions of digital twins and AI technologies in their plans and objectives towards successful industrial digital transformation with high return of investments.
Agent-based modelling of car platooning for traffic optimization,M. Lemiec; K. Malinowski; M. Szymoński; M. Ganzha; M. Paprzycki,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567855,NO,"In this context, we consider how an agent system that brings together multiple vehicles to form a “platoon” can effectively address problems in both areas. For instance, in 2015, over 26,000 people died and nearly 1.5 million people were injured on the roads [1] across the European Union."
