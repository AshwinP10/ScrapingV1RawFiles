Integrating mobile robots into human society involves the fundamental problem of navigation in crowds. A robot should attempt to navigate in a way that is minimally invasive to the humans in its environment. However, planning in a dynamic environment is difficult as the environment must be predicted into the future. This problem has been thoroughly studied considering the behaviour of pedestrians at the level of individuals. Instead, we represent a pedestrian crowd by its macroscopic properties over space, such as density and velocity. With this spatial representation, we propose to learn a convolutional recurrent model to predict these properties into the future. The key design of a probabilistic loss function capturing the crowd's macroscopic properties empowers the spatio-temporal crowd prediction. Using a social invasiveness metric defined on these properties predicted by our convolutional recurrent model, we develop a framework that produces globally-optimal plans in expectation. Extensive results using a realistic pedestrian simulator show the validity and performance of the proposed social navigation approach.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-9077-8","10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9561053","","Measurement;Uncertainty;Minimally invasive surgery;Navigation;Predictive models;Probabilistic logic;Search problems","estimation theory;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;navigation;object detection;object tracking;pedestrians;probability;spatiotemporal phenomena;video signal processing","probabilistic dynamic crowd prediction;crowd behaviour;robotic social navigation;mobile robots;human society;fundamental problem;dynamic environment;pedestrian crowd;macroscopic properties;spatial representation;convolutional recurrent model;probabilistic loss function;spatio-temporal crowd prediction;social invasiveness metric;globally-optimal plans;realistic pedestrian simulator;social navigation approach","","5","","29","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some social spaces tend to be large and crowded (e.g. museums, shopping malls), which require robots to move around while showing appropriate social behaviors (e.g. not interfering with human's comfortable areas). Moving under such conditions is generally called social robot navigation, and there are different approaches to do so. Nonetheless, current approaches are mostly limited to navigate large and outdoor spaces, where both robots and people can easily avoid each other. Other approaches have been tested in indoor environments, however, the test environments tend to be small and largely empty. In this paper, we present an online social robot navigation framework, which allow robots to navigate indoor, large and crowded environments, while showing social behaviors. Our framework consists of 3 modules: 1) world modeling that incorporates a novel Social Heatmap (SH) to represent crowded areas, 2) multilayered path planning that uses sampling-based approaches, and 3) path following control. We extensively benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art approaches in challenging simulated scenarios, and $w$ e also demonstrate its feasibility with the Pepper robot in real-world trials.","","979-8-3503-2365-8","10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10160603","","Heating systems;Automation;Navigation;Social robots;Benchmark testing;Path planning;Museums","human-robot interaction;mobile robots;path planning","appropriate social behaviors;crowded environments;indoor environments;new robotics applications;online social robot navigation framework;Pepper robot;Social Heatmap;social spaces;socially acceptable manner;test environments","","","","50","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nonetheless, involuntary contact may be unavoidable when the robot travels in crowded areas or when encountering adversarial pedestrians. Freezing the robot in response to contact might be detrimental to bystanders' safety and prevents it from achieving its task. Unavoidable contacts must hence be controlled to ensure the safe and smooth travelling of robots in pedestrian alleys. We present a force-limited and obstacle avoidance controller integrated into a time-invariant dynamical system (DS) in a closed-loop force controller that let the robot react instantaneously to contact or to the sudden appearance of pedestrians. Mitigating the risk of collision is done by modulating the velocity commands upon detecting a contact and by absorbing part of the contact force through active compliant control when the robot bumps inad-vertently against a pedestrian. We evaluated our method with a personal mobility robot -Qolo- showing contact mitigation with passive and active compliance. We showed the robot able to overcome an adversarial pedestrian within 9 N of the set limit contact force for speeds under 1 m/s. Moreover, we evaluated integrated obstacle avoidance proving the ability to advance without Incurring any other collision.","","978-1-7281-9681-7","10.1109/ICRA46639.2022.9811772","EPFL(grant numbers:HREC-032-2019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9811772","Mobile Service Robots;Human-Robot Interaction;Force control;Compliance and Impedance Control","Automation;Navigation;Service robots;Force;Safety;Impedance;Collision avoidance","closed loop systems;collision avoidance;force control;mobile robots;pedestrians;service robots","dynamical systems based compliance;contact control;robot navigation;mobile service robots;social rules;socially acceptable distance;involuntary contact;unavoidable contacts;pedestrian alleys;obstacle avoidance controller;time-invariant dynamical system;closed-loop force controller;contact force;active compliant control;robot bumps;personal mobility robot;contact mitigation;passive compliance;social navigation unfreezing;proxemics;force-limited controller;personal mobility robot-Qolo","","3","","30","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, most of them assume nodes are static, i.e., fixed on one place and cannot be applied to dynamic environments where some or all of nodes are moving. To address the aforementioned issues, a cooperative dynamic RO-SLAM (CDRO-SLAM) is proposed in this paper, which is a RO-SLAM algorithm based on sum of Gaussian (SoG) filter with cooperative measurements in dynamic environments. The proposed CDRO-SLAM integrates all the inter-node measurements for localization, which results in a smaller map estimation error with a faster convergence speed than the conventional ROSLAM. Moreover, the proposed CDRO-SLAM can also track movement of any nodes under the dynamic environment by resetting and updating the SoG variables.

While navigating in complex urban environments, the Bayesian occupancy grid is one of the most popular types of maps, where the information of occupancy is stored as the probability of collision. Although widely used, this kind of representation is not well suited for risk assessment: because of its discrete nature, the probability of collision becomes dependent on the tessellation size. Therefore, risk assessments on Bayesian occupancy grids cannot yield risks with meaningful physical units. In this article, we propose an alternative framework called Dynamic Lambda-Field that is able to assess generic physical risks in dynamic environments without being dependent on the tessellation size. Using our framework, we are able to plan safe trajectories where the risk function can be adjusted depending on the scenario. We validate our approach with quantitative experiments, showing the convergence speed of the grid and that the framework is suitable for real-world scenarios.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-1714-3","10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636804","","Navigation;Urban areas;Particle measurements;Real-time systems;Bayes methods;Trajectory;Risk management","Bayes methods;collision avoidance;mobile robots;probability;risk management","Bayesian occupancy grid;risk assessment;tessellation size;risk function;dynamic lambda-field framework;risk estimation;collision probability","","1","","16","IEEE","16 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite past attempts to deal with dynamic objects, challenges remain to reconstruct large, occluded areas with complex backgrounds. Our proposed Dynamic-GAN framework employs a generative adversarial network to remove dynamic objects from a scene and inpaint a static image free of dynamic objects. The Dynamic-GAN framework utilizes spatial-temporal transformers, and a novel spatial-temporal loss function. The evaluation of Dynamic-GAN was comprehensively conducted both quantitatively and qualitatively by testing it on benchmark datasets, and on a mobile robot in indoor navigation environments. As people appeared dynamically in close proximity to the robot, results showed that large, feature-rich occluded areas can be accurately reconstructed with our attention-based deep learning framework for dynamic object removal. Through experiments we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm has up to 25% better performance on average as compared to the standard benchmark algorithms.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-7927-1","10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981102","NSF(grant numbers:2026584,1849213); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9981102","","Deep learning;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Heuristic algorithms;Robot vision systems;Benchmark testing;Cameras;Transformers","cameras;feature extraction;image motion analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;object detection;object tracking;robot vision;SLAM (robots);video signal processing","attention-based deep learning framework;dynamic content;dynamic object removal;dynamic objects;Dynamic-GAN framework;feature-rich occluded areas;novel spatial-temporal loss function;robot camera frames;spatial-temporal attention","","","","44","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we want to go beyond first-order Human-Robot interaction and more explicitly model Crowd-Robot Interaction (CRI).

Our model captures the Human-Human interactions occurring in dense crowds that indirectly affects the robot's anticipation capability.

With SEAN- EP, remote users can virtually interact with a mobile robot in the Social Environment for Autonomous Navigation, without installing any software on their computer or needing specialized hardware. We validated that SEAN-EP could quickly scale the collection of human feedback and its usability through an online survey. In addition, we compared human feedback from participants that interacted with a robot using SEAN- EP with feedback obtained through a more traditional video survey.

However, due to EDs being overcrowded, and the cognitive overload HCWs experience, robots need to understand various levels of patient acuity so they avoid disrupting care delivery. In this paper, we introduce the Safety-Critical Deep Q-Network (SafeDQN) system, a new acuity-aware navigation system for mobile robots. SafeDQN is based on two insights about care in EDs: high-acuity patients tend to have more HCWs in attendance and those HCWs tend to move more quickly.

However, it is not feasible to learn and benchmark social navigation behaviors entirely in the real world, as learning is data-intensive, and it is challenging to make safety guarantees during training. Therefore, simulation-based benchmarks that provide abstractions for social navigation are required. A framework for these benchmarks would need to support a wide variety of learning approaches, be extensible to the broad range of social navigation scenarios, and abstract away the perception problem to focus on social navigation explicitly. While there have been many proposed solutions, including high fidelity 3D simulators and grid world approximations, no existing solution satisfies all of the aforementioned properties for learning and evaluating social navigation behaviors. In this work, we propose SocialGym, a lightweight 2D simulation environment for robot social navigation designed with extensibility in mind, and a benchmark scenario built on SocialGym. Further, we present benchmark results that compare and contrast human-engineered and model-based learning approaches to a suite of off-the-shelf Learning from Demonstration (LfD) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches applied to social robot navigation. These results demonstrate the data efficiency, task performance, social compliance, and environment transfer capabilities for each of the policies evaluated to provide a solid grounding for future social navigation research.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-7927-1","10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9982021","NSF(grant numbers:CAREER2046955,SHF-2006404); ARO(grant numbers:W911NF-19-20333,W911NF-21-20217); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9982021","","Training;Three-dimensional displays;Navigation;Social robots;Reinforcement learning;Benchmark testing;Solids","human-robot interaction;mobile robots;navigation;path planning;reinforcement learning","benchmark results;benchmark scenario;benchmark social navigation;dynamic human environments;essential benchmark;future social navigation research;high fidelity 3D simulators;learning approaches;lightweight 2D simulation environment;long-term robot autonomy;off-the-shelf learning;reinforcement learning;robot social navigation;simulation-based benchmarks;social compliance;social navigation behaviors;social navigation scenarios;social robot navigation;SocialGym;socially compliant manner","","3","","29","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Head orientation and gaze are both mechanisms which help people to interpret where other people intend to walk, which in turn enables them to coordinate their movement. Head orientation has previously been leveraged to develop classifiers which are able to predict the goal of a person‚Äôs walking motion. Gaze is believed to generally precede head orientation, with a person quickly moving their eyes to a target and then following it with a turn of their head. This study leverages state-of-the-art virtual reality technology to place participants into a simulated environment in which their gaze and motion can be observed. The results of this study indicate that position, velocity, head orientation, and gaze can all be used as predictive features of the goal of a person‚Äôs walking motion. The results also indicate that gaze both precedes head orientation and can be used to predict the goal of a person‚Äôs walking motion at a higher level of accuracy earlier in their walking trajectory.

Our current work focuses on integrating legible non-verbal behaviors into the robot's social navigation to make nearby humans aware of its intended trajectory. Results from a within-subjects study involving 33 participants show that deictic gestures as navigational cues for humanoid robots result in fewer navigation conflicts than the use of a simulated gaze.

State-of-the-art approaches to social navigation fall into two categories: model-based social constraints and learning-based approaches. While effective, these approaches have fundamental limitations ‚Äì model-based approaches require constraint and parameter tuning to adapt to preferences and new scenarios, while learning-based approaches require reward functions, significant training data, and are hard to adapt to new social scenarios or new domains with limited demonstrations.In this work, we propose Iterative Dimension Informed Program Synthesis (IDIPS) to address these limitations by learning and adapting social navigation in the form of human-readable symbolic programs. IDIPS works by combining pro-gram synthesis, parameter optimization, predicate repair, and iterative human demonstration to learn and adapt model-free action selection policies from orders of magnitude less data than learning-based approaches. We introduce a novel predicate repair technique that can accommodate previously unseen social scenarios or preferences by growing existing policies.We present experimental results showing that IDIPS: 1) synthesizes effective policies that model user preference, 2) can adapt existing policies to changing preferences, 3) can extend policies to handle novel social scenarios such as locked doors, and 4) generates policies that can be transferred from simulation to real-world robots with minimal effort.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-1714-3","10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636540","","Adaptation models;Navigation;Training data;Maintenance engineering;Data models;Elevators;Iterative methods","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;robot programming;social robots","Iterative Program Synthesis;adaptable social navigation;robot social navigation;human preferences;environment-specific scenarios;end-user adaptability;social navigation;model-based social constraints;learning-based approaches;model-based approaches;parameter tuning;human-readable symbolic programs;iterative human demonstration;model-free action selection policies;user preference;iterative dimension informed program synthesis;IDIPS;predicate repair technique","","","","22","IEEE","16 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a decentralized partially observable multi-agent path planning with evolutionary reinforcement learning (MAPPER) method to learn an effective local planning policy in mixed dynamic environments. Reinforcement learning-based methods usually suffer performance degradation on long-horizon tasks with goal-conditioned sparse rewards, so we decompose the long-range navigation task into many easier sub-tasks under the guidance of a global planner, which increases agents' performance in large environments. Moreover, most existing multi-agent planning approaches assume either perfect information of the surrounding environment or homogeneity of nearby dynamic agents, which may not hold in practice. Our approach models dynamic obstacles' behavior with an image-based representation and trains a policy in mixed dynamic environments without homogeneity assumption. To ensure multi-agent training stability and performance, we propose an evolutionary training approach that can be easily scaled to large and complex environments. Experiments show that MAPPER is able to achieve higher success rates and more stable performance when exposed to a large number of non-cooperative dynamic obstacles compared with traditional reaction-based planner LRA* and the state-of-the-art learning-based method.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-6212-6","10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9340876","Richard King Mellon Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9340876","","Training;Learning systems;Navigation;Reinforcement learning;Path planning;Planning;Task analysis","evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;multi-robot systems;path planning;robot vision","multiagent navigation;decentralized partially observable multiagent path;evolutionary reinforcement learning method;MAPPER;effective local planning policy;mixed dynamic environments;reinforcement learning-based methods;long-horizon tasks;long-range navigation task;existing multiagent planning approaches;nearby dynamic agents;evolutionary training approach;complex environments;noncooperative dynamic obstacles;state-of-the-art learning-based method;multiagent path planning","","29","","29","IEEE","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM system for dynamic environments that is capable of detecting both known and unknown moving objects. To reduce the computational cost, we only perform semantic segmentation on keyframes to remove known dynamic objects, and maintain a static map for robust camera tracking.

Nonetheless, collisions may still occur in the interpolation/transition between two valid states or in environments with thin obstacles. In this work, we introduce a computationally inexpensive continuous-time collision avoidance term in presence of static and moving obstacles. Our penalty is based on conservative advancement and harmonic potential fields and can be used as either a cost or constraint in off-the-shelf non-linear programming solvers.

However, due to its under-actuated characteristic, there are still many challenges for anthropomorphic control of all the degrees of freedom (DOFs) using less input. It is challenging to map the human hand kinematic synergies on robotic hands, particularly for a dynamic environment. Therefore, it is worth studying how to control the under-actuated bionic hand effectively in a dynamic environment.

To address the limitation, this paper proposes a trajectory planning framework to achieve safe navigation considering complex static environments with dynamic obstacles.

Sampling-based motion planning algorithms find solutions by approximating the robot‚Äôs configuration space through a graph representation, predicting or computing obstacles‚Äô trajectories, and finding feasible paths via a pathfinding algorithm. In this work, we seek to improve the performance of these subproblems by identifying regions critical to dynamic environment navigation and leveraging them to construct sparse probabilistic roadmaps. Motion planning and pathfinding algorithms should allow robots to prevent encounters with obstacles, irrespective of their trajectories, by being conscious of spatial context cues such as the location of chokepoints (e.g., doorways). Thus, we propose a self-supervised methodology for learning to identify regions frequently used for obstacle avoidance from local environment features. As an application of this concept, we leverage a neural network to generate hierarchical probabilistic roadmaps termed Avoidance Critical Probabilistic Roadmaps (ACPRM). These roadmaps contain motion structures that enable efficient obstacle avoidance, reduce the search and planning space, and increase a roadmap‚Äôs reusability and coverage.

Despite intensive research on models of collective decision-making, the implementation in multi-robot systems is still challenging. Here, we advance the state of the art by introducing more plasticity to the decision-making process and by increasing the scenario difficulty. Most studies on large-scale multi-robot decision-making are limited to one instance of an iterated exploration-dissemination phase followed by successful and permanent convergence. We investigate a dynamic environment that requires constant collective monitoring of option qualities. Once a significant change in qualities is detected by the swarm, it has to collectively reconsider its previous decision accordingly. This is only possible by preventing lock-ins, a global consensus state of no return (i.e., a dominant majority of robots prevents the swarm from switching to another, possibly better option). In addition, we introduce a scenario of increased difficulty as the robots must locate themselves to assess the quality of an option. Using local communication, swarm robots propagate hop-count information throughout the swarm to form a global reference frame. We successfully validate our implementation in many swarm robot experiments concerning robustness to disruptions of the reference frame, scalability, and adaptivity to a dynamic environment.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-4004-9","10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8967777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8967777","","","decision making;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;plasticity","dynamic environment;preventing lock-ins;large-scale multirobot decision-making;global reference frame;swarm robot experiments;plasticity;iterated exploration-dissemination phase;hop-count information;local communication","","5","","21","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This raw information is not suitable as a shared representation between the robot and its user. A semantic map, containing high-level information that both the robot and user understand, is better suited to be a shared representation. We use the semantic map as the user-facing interface on our fleet of floor-cleaning robots. Jitter in the robot's sensed raw map, dynamic objects in the environment, and exploration of new space by the robot are common challenges for robots. Solving these challenges effectively in the context of semantic maps is key to enabling semantic maps for lifelong mapping. First, as a robot senses new changes and alters its raw map in successive runs, the semantics must be updated appropriately. We update the map using a spatial transfer of semantics. Second, it is important to keep semantics and their relative constraints consistent even in the presence of dynamic objects. Inconsistencies are automatically determined and resolved through the introduction of a map layer of meta-semantics. Finally, a discovery phase allows the semantic map to be updated with new semantics whenever the robot uncovers new information.

This raises safety concerns, limiting the range of possible applications of mobile robots in the real world. Motivated by these challenges, in this work we present Temporal-PRM, a novel sampling-based path-planning algorithm that performs obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments. The proposed approach extends the original Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) with the notion of time, generating an augmented graph-like structure that can be efficiently queried using a time-aware variant of the A* search algorithm, also introduced in this paper. Our design maintains all the properties of PRM, such as the ability to perform multiple queries and to find smooth paths, while circumventing its downside by enabling collision avoidance in highly dynamic scenes with a minor increase in the computational cost.

In this paper, we address the LTL path planning problem in a dynamic environment where the newly arrived dynamic obstacles may invalidate some of the available paths at any arbitrary point in time.

The local collision avoidance module computes a set of safe controls that guarantees a safe distance between the moving objects. Both of the modules can be rigorously computed offline only once via formal methods. The patcher is activated whenever a moving obstacle is detected and modifies the static plan online for a short horizon by using only provably safe controls.

To fly safely and efficiently, trajectory planners and trackers must be able to navigate unknown environments with unpredictable aerodynamic effects in real-time. When encountering aerodynamic effects such as strong winds, most current approaches to quadrotor trajectory planning and tracking will not attempt to deviate from a determined plan, even if it is risky, in the hope that any aerodynamic disturbances can be resisted by a robust controller. This paper presents a novel systematic trajectory planning and tracking framework for autonomous quadrotors. We propose a Kinodynamic Jump Space Search (Kino-JSS) to generate a safe and efficient route in unknown environments with aerodynamic disturbances. A real-time Gaussian Process is employed to model the errors caused by aerodynamic disturbances, which we then integrate with a Model Predictive Controller to achieve efficient and accurate trajectory optimization and tracking. We demonstrate our system to improve the efficiency of trajectory generation in unknown environments by up to 75% in the cases tested, compared with recent state-of-the-art.

Motion planning methods for autonomous driving and mobile robots typically need to rely on the spatial constraints imposed by a map-based global planner to generate a collision-free trajectory. These methods may fail without an offline map or where the map is invalid due to dynamic changes in the environment such as road obstruction, construction, and traffic congestion. To address this problem, triangulation-based methods can be used to obtain a spatial constraint. However, the existing methods fall short when dealing with dynamic environments and may lead the motion planner to an unrecoverable state. In this paper, we propose a new method to generate a sequence of channels across different triangulation mesh topologies to serve as the spatial constraints. This can be applied to motion planning of autonomous vehicles or robots in cluttered, unstructured environments. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with other triangulation-based methods in synthetic and complex scenarios collected from a real-world autonomous driving dataset. We have shown that the proposed method results in a more stable, long-term plan with a higher task completion rate, faster arrival time, a higher rate of successful plans, and fewer collisions compared to existing methods.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-1714-3","10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636067","","Roads;Dynamics;Semantics;Planning;Trajectory;Topology;Vehicle dynamics","collision avoidance;mobile robots;path planning;road vehicles","spatial constraint generation;motion planning;dynamic environments;autonomous driving robots;mobile robots;map-based global planner;offline map;dynamic changes;triangulation-based methods;motion planner;cluttered environments;unstructured environments;long-term plan;successful plans","","","","19","IEEE","16 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This issue is further exacerbated when the learned information is unreliable and inaccurate. In this paper, we aim to enhance the safety of learning-enabled mobile robots in dynamic environments from the perspective of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and the unscented transform (UT). Our method infers the unknown dynamics of both the robot and the environment by adopting Gaussian process regression with an uncertainty propagation scheme based on UT to improve prediction accuracy. This leads to a novel learning-based model predictive control (MPC) method in which state information about both the robot and the environment is propagated via UT. The proposed method uses DRO to proactively limit the risk of collisions or other unsafe events in the presence of learning errors. However, the distributionally robust risk constraint is intractable because it involves a separate infinite-dimensional optimization problem. To overcome this challenge, we exploit UT with modern DRO techniques to replace the risk constraint with its simple upper bound. The performance and the utility of our method are demonstrated through simulations in autonomous driving scenarios, showing its capability to enhance safety and computational efficiency.","","979-8-3503-2365-8","10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10161246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10161246","","Motion planning;Upper bound;Uncertainty;Dynamics;Transforms;Gaussian processes;Safety","Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;motion control;optimisation;predictive control;regression analysis","applying learning-based motion controllers;distributionally robust optimization;distributionally robust risk constraint;Gaussian process regression;infinite-dimensional optimization problem;learned information;learning errors;learning-based motion control;learning-enabled mobile robots;modern DRO techniques;novel learning-based model predictive control method;practical robotic systems;state information;surrounding dynamic environments;uncertainty propagation scheme;unknown dynamics;unscented transform;UT","","","","54","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we propose a gradient-based planner on the state-time space for online trajectory generation in highly dynamic environments. To enable the gradient-based optimization, we propose a Timed-ESDT that supports distance and gradient queries with state-time keys. Based on the Timed-ESDT, we also define a smooth prior and an obstacle likelihood function that are compatible with the state-time space. The trajectory planning is then formulated to a MAP problem and solved by an efficient numerical optimizer. Moreover, to improve the optimality of the planner, we also define a state-time graph and conduct path searching on it to find a better initialization for the optimizer. By integrating the graph searching, the planning quality is significantly improved. Experiments on simulated and benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposes method over conventional ones.","","978-1-7281-9681-7","10.1109/ICRA46639.2022.9812436","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9812436","","Automation;Trajectory planning;Benchmark testing;Planning;Trajectory;Optimization","collision avoidance;gradient methods;graph theory;mobile robots;optimisation;path planning;search problems","online state-time trajectory planning;highly dynamic environments;state-time space;existing state-time planners;gradient-based planner;online trajectory generation;gradient-based optimization;Timed-ESDT;state-time keys;state-time graph;conduct path;Timed-ESDF","","","","30","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most of the current lidar SLAM approaches are based on the assumption of a static environment. Hence the localization in a dynamic environment with multiple moving objects is actually unreliable. The paper proposes a dynamic SLAM framework RF-LIO, building on LIO-SAM, which adds adaptive multi-resolution range images and uses tightly-coupled lidar inertial odometry to first remove moving objects, and then match lidar scan to the submap. Thus, it can obtain accurate poses even in high dynamic environments. The proposed RF-LIO is evaluated on both self-collected datasets and open Urbanloco datasets. The experimental results in high dynamic environments demonstrate that, compared with LOAM and LIO-SAM, the absolute trajectory accuracy of the proposed RF-LIO can be improved by 90% and 70%, respectively. RF-LIO is one of the state-of-the-art SLAM systems in high dynamic environments.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-1714-3","10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636624","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636624","","Location awareness;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Laser radar;Heuristic algorithms;Training data;Real-time systems;Trajectory","distance measurement;mobile robots;object detection;optical radar;path planning;pose estimation;robot vision;SLAM (robots)","lidar inertial odometry;high dynamic environments;current lidar SLAM approaches;static environment;dynamic environment;dynamic SLAM framework RF-LIO;LIO-SAM;lidar scan","","","","25","IEEE","16 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A typical approach to such problems is that a robot predicts the trajectories of dynamic obstacles, and plans its path while avoiding them. Such a formulation becomes limiting though for scenarios where an agent cannot complete its task efficiently, without disrupting the movement of dynamic obstacles. For example, when merging in heavy traffic or navigating through crowded corridors. In this paper, we propose a paradigm for planning in dynamic environments, called Disruption-Limited Planning (DLP), that allows a robot to disrupt the motions of dynamic obstacles in order to accomplish its task. DLP builds on the premise that while a robot may have to disrupt others‚Äô trajectories to achieve its goals, it should try to limit the disruption. DLP assumes that it can estimate others‚Äô response to its own actions/plans, and plans its own path while ensuring that no other agents‚Äô disrupted trajectory cost gets worse than w-times their initial trajectory costs. While our formulation is motivated by the Stackelberg competitions, we show that DLP can be both more expressive and computationally more efficient compared to a Stackelberg planner. We present DLP paradigm, develop its efficient implementation based on A*, analyze its theoretical properties, and apply it to multiple planning in dynamic environment problems, including x,y,time planning, planning for self-driving, and planning for arm manipulation. We compare DLP with purely altruistic, purely egocentric, and optimal Stackelberg planners, demonstrating the efficacy of DLP over these alternatives.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-1714-3","10.1109/IROS51168.2021.9636274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636274","","Costs;Limiting;Navigation;Dynamics;Merging;Planning;Trajectory","collision avoidance;game theory;mobile robots;path planning","dynamic environment problems;time planning;DLP;robot navigation;dynamic environments;path planning;dynamic obstacles;robotics;called Disruption-Limited Planning;agents;initial trajectory costs;multiple planning","","","","24","IEEE","16 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, chance constraints are incorporated into the planning problem to provide probabilistic safety guarantees by imposing an upper bound on the collision probability of the planned trajectory. Yet, this results in an overly conservative behavior on the grounds that the gap between the obtained risk and the specified upper limit is not explicitly restricted. To address this issue, we propose a real-time capable approach to quantify the risk associated with planned trajectories obtained from multiple probabilistic planners, running in parallel, with different upper bounds of the acceptable risk level. Based on the evaluated risk, the least conservative plan is selected provided that its associated risk is below a specified threshold. In such a way, the proposed approach provides probabilistic safety guarantees by attaining a closer bound to the specified risk, while being applicable to generic uncertainties of moving obstacles.

In this paper, we leverage the mutual dependence between camera ego-motion and motion segmentation and show that both can be jointly refined in a single learning-based framework. In particular, we present DytanVO, the first supervised learning-based VO method that deals with dynamic environments. It takes two consecutive monocular frames in real-time and predicts camera ego-motion in an iterative fashion. Our method achieves an average improvement of 27.7% in ATE over state-of-the-art VO solutions in real-world dynamic environments, and even performs competitively among dynamic visual SLAM systems which optimize the trajectory on the backend.

We extended it to have the capability of dealing with dynamic environments. Therefore, it must avoid global lock-in states. In many realistic applications the robot swarm needs to adapt to (collectively) measurable changes at runtime by revising previous collective decisions.

From the perspective of the robot, humans are dynamic obstacles that must be avoided. These obstacles make the collision-free space nonconvex, which leads to two distinct passing behaviors per obstacle (passing left or right). For local planners, such as receding-horizon trajectory optimization, each behavior presents a local optimum in which the planner can get stuck. This may result in slow or unsafe motion even when a better plan exists. In this work, we identify trajectories for multiple locally optimal driving behaviors, by considering their topology.

The mapping method combines an object detection algorithm and a SLAM algorithm to detect semi-dynamic objects and constructs a semantic map that only contains semi-dynamic objects in the environment. During navigation, the localization method can classify observation corresponding to static and non-static objects respectively and evaluate whether those semi-dynamic objects have moved, to reduce the weight of invalid observation and localization fluctuation.

The challenges to overcome when steering a wheelchair are to find smooth feasible trajectories, maintain a fast reactive response to dynamic obstacles and to satisfy a set of additional constraints such as limiting physical forces acting on the wheelchair occupants. Our approach is a variant of the timed-elastic-bands (TEB) planner, which includes a footprint of the wheelchair during optimization, and generates a steering angle which is then consumed by an arm controller to actuate the relative orientation between the wheelchair and the mobile platform. This is realized by posing new non-holonomic and kinodynamic constraints on the TEB planner and an implementation of a suitable real-time dual-arm controller for executing steering commands. We demonstrate our results based on a TEB baseline comparison in simulation using functional models of our robot HoLLiE and a wheelchair.","","979-8-3503-2365-8","10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10161082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10161082","","Limiting;Automation;Wheelchairs;Dynamics;Real-time systems;Trajectory;Planning","collision avoidance;handicapped aids;mobile robots;path planning;robot dynamics;wheelchairs","dynamic environments;dynamic obstacles;fast reactive response;kinodynamic constraints;long-established research fields;mobile holonomic robots;mobile platform;mobile robot platforms;mobile robots steering nonholonomic wheelchairs;motion planning;nonholonomic conventional passive wheelchairs;robot HoLLiE;smooth feasible trajectories;steering angle;steering commands;TEB planner;timed-elastic-bands planner;trajectory planner;wheelchair occupants","","","","17","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This scalability issue prevents MARL from being applied in large-scale multiagent systems. However, one critical feature in MARL that is often neglected is that the interactions between agents are quite sparse. Without exploiting this sparsity structure, existing works aggregate information from all of the agents and thus have a high sample complexity. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive sparse attention mechanism by generalizing a sparsity-inducing activation function. Then a sparse communication graph in MARL is learned by graph neural networks based on this new attention mechanism. Through this sparsity structure, the agents can communicate in an effective as well as efficient way via only selectively attending to agents that matter the most and thus the scale of the MARL problem is reduced with little optimality compromised. Comparative results show that our algorithm can learn an interpretable sparse structure and outperforms previous works by a significant margin on applications involving a large-scale multiagent system.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-6212-6","10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9341303","","Scalability;Aggregates;Reinforcement learning;Graph neural networks;Complexity theory;Intelligent robots;Multi-agent systems","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;multi-robot systems;neural nets","interpretable sparse structure;MARL problem;graph neural networks;sparsity-inducing activation function;adaptive sparse attention mechanism;sample complexity;large-scale multiagent system;scalability issue;adaptive sparse communication graph;robotic systems;multiagent reinforcement learning","","7","","32","IEEE","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Understanding the space of behavior of real-world traffic may offer significant advantages for algorithmic design, data-driven methodologies, and bench-marking. However, the high dimensionality of the space and the stochasticity of human behavior may hinder the identification of important interaction patterns. Our key insight is that traffic environments feature significant geometric and temporal structure, leading to highly organized collective behaviors, often drawn from a small set of dominant modes. In this work, we propose a representation based on the formalism of topological braids that can summarize arbitrarily complex multiagent behavior into a compact object of dual geometric and symbolic nature, capturing critical events of interaction. This representation allows us to formally enumerate the space of outcomes in a traffic scene and characterize their complexity. We illustrate the value of the proposed representation in summarizing critical aspects of real-world traffic behavior through a case study on recent driving datasets. We show that despite the density of real-world traffic, observed behavior tends to follow highly organized patterns of low interaction. Our framework may be a valuable tool for evaluating the richness of driving datasets, but also for synthetically designing balanced training datasets or benchmarks.","","978-1-7281-9681-7","10.1109/ICRA46639.2022.9812118","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2007011,1839371); Office of Naval Research; Amazon; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9812118","","Training;Automation;Design methodology;Transforms;Benchmark testing;Filtering theory;Behavioral sciences","learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;road traffic","highly organized collective behaviors;dominant modes;topological braids;arbitrarily complex multiagent behavior;dual geometric nature;symbolic nature;traffic scene;real-world traffic behavior;highly organized patterns;low interaction;multiagent interactions;traffic domains;algorithmic design;data-driven methodologies;bench-marking;human behavior;important interaction patterns;traffic environments;significant geometric structure;temporal structure","","3","","44","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We focus on policies that 1) give rise to coordination amongst the vehicles, thereby reducing wait times for servicing requests, 2) are non-myopic, and consider a-priori potential future requests, 3) can adapt to changes in the underlying demand distribution. Specifically, we are interested in policies that are adaptive to fluctuations of actual demand conditions in urban environments, such as on-peak vs. off-peak hours. We achieve this through a combination of (i) an online play algorithm that improves the performance of an offline-trained policy, and (ii) an offline approximation scheme that allows for adapting to changes in the underlying demand model. In particular, we achieve adaptivity of our learned policy to different demand distributions by quantifying a region of validity using the q-valid radius of a Wasserstein Ambiguity Set. We propose a mechanism for switching the originally trained offline approximation when the current demand is outside the original validity region. In this case, we propose to use an offline architecture, trained on a historical demand model that is closer to the current demand in terms of Wasserstein distance. We learn routing and pickup policies over real taxicab requests in San Francisco with high variability between on-peak and off-peak hours, demonstrating the ability of our method to adapt to real fluctuation in demand distributions.

In multiagent competitive scenarios, agents may have to adapt to new opponents with previously unseen behaviors by learning from the interaction experiences between the ego-agent and the opponent. However, this adaptation is susceptible to opponent exploitation. As the ego-agent updates its own behavior to exploit the opponent, its own behavior could become more exploitable as a result of overfitting to this specific opponent's behavior. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a safe adaptation approach in which the ego-agent is trained against a regularized opponent model, which effectively avoids overfitting and consequently improves the robustness of the ego-agent's policy. We evaluated our approach in the Mujoco domain with two competing agents.

Our model is also designed such that it can handle usual cases in which robots can be equipped with sensor suites that only offer limited field of view. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, which is shown in simulated environments containing human-like agents and static obstacles.

For this navigation ability, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods are gaining increasing attentions. However, existing DRL methods require a wide field of view (FOV), which imposes the usage of high-cost lidar devices. In this paper, we explore the possibility of replacing expensive lidar devices with affordable depth cameras which have a limited FOV. First, we analyze the effect of a limited field of view in the DRL agents. Second, we propose a LSTM agent with Local-Map Critic (LSTM-LMC), which is a novel DRL method to learn efficient navigation in a complex environment with a limited FOV. Lastly, we introduce the dynamics randomization technique to improve the robustness of the DRL agents in the real world. We found that our method with a limited FOV can outperform the methods having a wide FOV but limited memory. We provide the empirical evidence that our method learns to implicitly model the surrounding environment and dynamics of other agents. We also show that a robot with a single depth camera can navigate through a complex real-world environment using our method.","2577-087X","978-1-5386-6027-0","10.1109/ICRA.2019.8793979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8793979","","Navigation;Mobile robots;Reinforcement learning;Laser radar;Robot sensing systems;Cameras","cameras;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;navigation;neural nets;optical radar;path planning;robot vision","deep reinforcement learning-based methods;DRL agents;LSTM agent;Local-Map Critic;LSTM-LMC;wide FOV;single depth camera;mobile robots;lidar devices;DRL method;depth cameras;dynamics randomization technique","","31","","36","IEEE","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While useful for this purpose, this image-plane density has no immediate physical meaning because it is subject to perspective distortion. This is a concern in sequences acquired by drones because the viewpoint changes often. This distortion is usually handled implicitly by either learning scale-invariant features or estimating density in patches of different sizes, neither of which accounts for the fact that scale changes must be consistent over the whole scene.In this paper, we explicitly model the scale changes and reason in terms of people per square-meter. We show that feeding the perspective model to the network allows us to enforce global scale consistency and that this model can be obtained on the fly from the drone sensors. In addition, it also enables us to enforce physically-inspired temporal consistency constraints that do not have to be learned. This yields an algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inferring crowd density from a moving drone camera especially when perspective effects are strong.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-4004-9","10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8967852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8967852","","","computerised instrumentation;density measurement;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence)","global scale consistency;drone sensors;temporal consistency constraints;moving drone camera;drone-based head plane crowd density estimation;deep networks;image-plane density;perspective distortion;learning scale-invariant features","","28","","25","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Alternatively, most local motion planners only address imminent collision avoidance and fail to offer long-term optimality. In this work, we present an approach, called Dynamic Channels, to solve this global to local quandary. Our method combines the high-level topological path planning with low-level motion planning into a complete pipeline. By formulating the path planning problem as graph-searching in the triangulation space, our planner is able to explicitly reason about the obstacle dynamics and capture the environmental change efficiently. We evaluate efficiency and performance of our approach on public pedestrian datasets and compare it to a state-of-the-art planning algorithm for dynamic obstacle avoidance.

Our proposed Learning to Balance (L2B) framework enables mobile robot agents to steer safely towards their destinations by avoiding collisions with a crowd, while actively clearing a path by asking nearby pedestrians to make room, if necessary, to keep their travel efficient. We observe that the safety and efficiency requirements in crowd-aware navigation have a trade-off in the presence of social dilemmas between the agent and the crowd. On the one hand, intervening in pedestrian paths too much to achieve instant efficiency will result in collapsing a natural crowd flow and may eventually put everyone, including the self, at risk of collisions. On the other hand, keeping in silence to avoid every single collision will lead to the agent's inefficient travel. With this observation, our L2B framework augments the reward function used in learning an interactive navigation policy to penalize frequent active path clearing and passive collision avoidance, which substantially improves the balance of the safety-efficiency trade-off. We evaluate our L2B framework in a challenging crowd simulation and demonstrate its superiority, in terms of both navigation success and collision rate, over a state-of-the-art navigation approach.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-6212-6","10.1109/IROS45743.2020.9341519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9341519","","Navigation;Swarm robotics;Reinforcement learning;Safety;Mobile robots;Collision avoidance;Task analysis","collision avoidance;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;navigation;pedestrians","safety-efficiency trade-off;interactive crowd-aware robot navigation;crowded place;mobile robot agents;crowd-aware navigation;pedestrian paths;natural crowd flow;interactive navigation policy;frequent active path clearing;passive collision avoidance;challenging crowd simulation;navigation success;collision rate;deep reinforcement learning","","13","","38","IEEE","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, ensuring their safe flight in areas containing people is a top priority. In this paper, a deep neural network-based method is proposed for the task of visual human crowd detection from UAV footage, allowing a drone to rapidly extract semantic segmentation maps from captured video frames during flight. These maps can be exploited (e.g., by a path planner) to define no-fly zones over, or near human crowds and, hence, enhance UAV flight safety. To this end, a novel neural architecture for binary (crowd/non- crowd) semantic segmentation from single RGB images is proposed, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It consists of a semantic segmentation and an image-to-image translation (I2I) neural branch. The overall network is trained using a novel multi-task loss function that addresses both tasks by processing the output of the corresponding branch. During inference, information flows across branches through additional skip synapses to further assist the crowd detection task. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we introduce a real and a synthetic human crowd RGB image dataset. The proposed method outperforms previous aerial crowd detection methods by a large margin and without any post-processing. Moreover, it demonstrates increased generalization ability, while running at real-time and near-real-time speeds on a ground computer and on embedded AI hardware, respectively.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-9077-8","10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9560830","","Image segmentation;Visualization;Semantics;Computer architecture;Real-time systems;Safety;Convolutional neural networks","autonomous aerial vehicles;cameras;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image recognition;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object detection;path planning;remotely operated vehicles;video signal processing","novel neural architecture;single RGB images;Convolutional Neural Networks;image-to-image translation;neural branch;novel multitask loss function;crowd detection task;synthetic human crowd RGB image dataset;previous aerial crowd detection methods;autonomous UAV safety;visual human crowd detection;multitask deep Neural Networks;camera-equipped UAVs;drone;safe flight;deep neural network-based method;UAV footage;semantic segmentation maps;human crowds;UAV flight safety","","12","","38","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The data consists of 92 traffic scenarios, with multiple ways of traversing each scenario. Multiple annotators expressed their preference between pairs of scenario traversals. We used the data to compare an instance of a rulebook [1], carefully hand-crafted independently of the dataset, with several interpretable machine learning models such as Bayesian networks, decision trees, and logistic regression trained on the dataset. To compare driving behavior, these models use scores indicating by how much different scenario traversals violate each of 14 driving rules. The rules are interpretable and designed by subject-matter experts. First, we found that these rules were enough for these models to achieve a high classification accuracy on the dataset. Second, we found that the rulebook provides high interpretability without excessively sacrificing performance. Third, the data pointed to possible improvements in the rulebook and the rules, and to potential new rules.

Most walking strategies propose to re-plan the walking motion to adapt to changing environments only once at every footstep. This is because a footstep is planted on the ground, it usually stays there at a constant position until the next footstep is initiated, what naturally constrains the capacity for the robot to react and adapt its motion in between footsteps. The objective of this paper is to measure if re-planning the walking motion more often than once at every footstep can lead to an improvement in collision avoidance when navigating in a crowd. Our result is that re-planning twice (or more) during each footstep leads to a significant reduction of the number of collisions when walking in a crowd, but depends on the density of the crowd.","2153-0866","978-1-7281-4004-9","10.1109/IROS40897.2019.8968070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8968070","","","collision avoidance;humanoid robots;legged locomotion;path planning;predictive control;robot dynamics","walking motion;planning period;MPC-based navigation;biped robot;model predictive control scheme;stable walking motions;automatic footstep placement;walking strategies","","3","","23","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, we use a large open human trajectory dataset that was experimentally collected in a crowded public space. We then recreate these human trajectories in a 3D robotic simulator, and generate demonstration data using a LIDAR sensor onboard a robot with the robot following the measured human trajectories. We then propose a GAIL based algorithm, which uses occupancy maps generated using LIDAR data as the input, and outputs the navigation policy for robot navigation. Simulation experiments are conducted, and performance evaluation shows that the learned navigation policy generates trajectories qualitatively and quantitatively similar to human trajectories.

The tasks of guiding or following a human in a crowded environment such as airports or train stations to carry weight or goods is still an open problem. In these use cases, the robot is not only required to intelligently interact with humans, but also to navigate safely among crowds. Thus, especially highly dynamic environments pose a grand challenge due to the volatile behavior patterns and unpredictable movements of humans. In this paper, we propose a Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-based agent for human-guiding and -following tasks in crowded environments. Therefore, we incorporate semantic information to provide the agent with high-level information like the social states of humans, safety models, and class types. We evaluate our proposed approach against a benchmark approach without semantic information and demonstrated enhanced navigational safety and robustness.

Recent advances in using data-driven approaches have achieved significant improvements in terms of prediction accuracy. However, the lack of group-aware analysis has limited the performance of forecasting models. This is especially nonnegligible in highly crowded scenes, where pedestrians are moving in groups and the interactions between groups are extremely complex and dynamic. In this paper, we present Grouptron, a multi-scale dynamic forecasting framework that leverages pedestrian group detection and utilizes individual-level, group-level and scene-level information for better understanding and representation of the scenes. Our approach employs spatio-temporal clustering algorithms to identify pedestrian groups, creates spatio-temporal graphs at the individual, group, and scene levels. It then uses graph neural networks to encode dynamics at different scales and aggregate the embeddings for trajectory prediction. We conducted extensive comparisons and ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method achieves 9.3% decrease in final displacement error (FDE) compared with state-of-the-art methods on ETH/UCY benchmark datasets, and 16.1% decrease in FDE in more crowded scenes where extensive human group interactions are more frequently present.","","978-1-7281-9681-7","10.1109/ICRA46639.2022.9811585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9811585","","Automation;Heuristic algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Benchmark testing;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Graph neural networks","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object detection;object tracking;pattern clustering;pedestrians;spatiotemporal phenomena;video signal processing;video surveillance","pedestrians;Grouptron;multiscale dynamic forecasting framework;pedestrian group detection;utilizes individual-level;group-level;scene-level information;spatio-temporal clustering algorithms;pedestrian groups;spatio-temporal graphs;individual group;scene levels;graph neural networks;trajectory prediction;extensive human group interactions;dynamic multiscale graph convolutional networks;group-aware dense crowd trajectory;long-term forecasting;pedestrian trajectories;highly dynamic scenes;interactive scenes;longstanding challenge;data-driven approaches;prediction accuracy;group-aware analysis;forecasting models;highly crowded scenes","","3","","41","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning architecture that combines a spatial graph and attention rea-soning to tackle this problem. We take the relative positions and velocities of observed humans as nodes of the spatial graph and robot-human pairs as nodes of the attention graph to capture the spatial relations between the robot and the humans. In this way, our approach enhances the modeling of the relationship between the moving robot, static obstacles, and the people in the surrounding. As a result, our proposed navigation framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches [1], [2] in crowded scenarios when the robot has only a limited sensor range in terms of a reduced collision rate.

We present comparative results between two low-level obstacle avoidance methods and a baseline of shared control. Results show a 10% drop in relative time to goal on the highest density tests, and no other efficiency metric decrease. Moreover, autonomous navigation showed to be comparable to shared-control navigation with a lower relative jerk and significantly higher fluency in commands indicating high compatibility with the crowd.

Nevertheless, even though the results provided are promising, the works are not able to take advantage of the capabilities that their models offer. They usually get trapped in local optima in the training process, that prevent them from learning the optimal policy. They are not able to visit and interact with every possible state appropriately, such as with the states near the goal or near the dynamic obstacles. In this work, we propose using intrinsic rewards to balance between exploration and exploitation and explore depending on the uncertainty of the states instead of on the time the agent has been trained, encouraging the agent to get more curious about unknown states. We explain the benefits of the approach and compare it with other exploration algorithms that may be used for crowd navigation. Many simulation experiments are performed modifying several algorithms of the state-of-the-art, showing that the use of intrinsic rewards makes the robot learn faster and reach higher rewards and success rates (fewer collisions) in shorter navigation times, outperforming the state-of-the-art.","","979-8-3503-2365-8","10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10160876","","Training;Uncertainty;Navigation;Smart cities;Heuristic algorithms;Focusing;Reinforcement learning","collision avoidance;deep learning (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;navigation;path planning;reinforcement learning;robot programming;smart cities;traffic engineering computing","autonomous navigation;crowd navigation;crowded environments;deep reinforcement learning approaches;dynamic obstacles;exploration algorithms;higher rewards;intrinsic rewards;model-based algorithms;open problem;optimal policy;possible state;robot navigation;shorter navigation times;smart cities;training process;unknown states","","1","","39","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More specifically, in order to increase generalization ability in crowd sizes, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is at first adopted to extract the relationships between robot and pedestrians. Then the relation features are further utilized as the inputs of the pedestrian state prediction network, the actor network, and the critic network. To efficiently and safely learn the navigation policy, all networks are pretrained through imitating ORCA which is a state-of-the-art algorithm in crowd navigation, and then a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) method which combines the model prediction and the clipped advantage-weighted regression is proposed to finetune the networks. Finally, simulation experiments are performed and it‚Äôs verified that the proposed learning method performs significantly better than ORCA and the other state-of-the-art RL methods.","2577-087X","978-1-7281-9077-8","10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561884","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9561884","","Learning systems;Training;Automation;Navigation;Conferences;Reinforcement learning;Predictive models","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;motion control;traffic engineering computing","actor network;critic network;navigation policy;state-of-the-art algorithm;crowd navigation;model-based reinforcement learning method;model prediction;navigation learning method;pedestrian state prediction network;relation features;pedestrians;graph convolutional network;generalization ability;differential-drive mobile robots;relational graph;continuous action space;relational navigation learning;state-of-the-art RL methods","","","","22","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Poor balance or bad intent recognition causes the robot to stop conservatively or advance rashly, resulting in a deadlock or even a collision respectively. To address the issue, this paper proposes an improved limit cycle for collaboratively parameterizing human intentions and planning robot motions. The human-robot interaction is modeled as a dynamic chicken game with incomplete information, where the human gaze is introduced to depict the unique characteristics of each person, allowing the robot to approach with different safety margins. Our method is tested in challenging indoor scenarios and outperforms traditional methods in both safety and efficiency. We enable robots to utilize human wisdom to solve problems that cannot be solved on their own. The robot bravely goes through oncoming crowds by getting closer to people with higher attention on it and has the foresight to stably cross in front or behind people.","","979-8-3503-2365-8","10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10161222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10161222","","Robot motion;Navigation;Limit-cycles;Human-robot interaction;Games;System recovery;Safety","human-robot interaction;mobile robots;path planning","bad intent recognition;balancing safety;different safety margins;dynamic chicken game;human gaze helps robots run bravely;human intentions;human wisdom;human-aware navigation;human-robot interaction;improved limit cycle;indoor scenarios;outperforms traditional methods;planning robot motions;robot tacitly games","","","","25","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present an approach for interactive and human-friendly crowd navigation in complex static environments. The planner models the online interactions among the robot, humans, and the static environment based on game theory. It recurrently expands and optimizes the estimated trajectories for the robot and neighboring agents and provides human-friendly navigation commands. We use various indicators to evaluate the social awareness of the planners and show that our method outperforms existing approaches in success rate to reach the goals and compatibility with humans while maintaining low navigation times. The planner is successfully deployed on a real-world quadrupedal robot, demonstrating safe and interactive crowd navigation with real-time performance.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-7927-1","10.1109/IROS47612.2022.9981697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9981697","","Navigation;Mobile agents;Nash equilibrium;Real-time systems;Trajectory;Behavioral sciences;Quadrupedal robots","game theory;legged locomotion;path planning","crowd navigation;game theory;human behaviors;human crowds;human-friendly crowd navigation;human-friendly navigation commands;neighboring agents;online interactive approach;quadrupedal robots;real-world quadrupedal robot;robot navigation","","","","44","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With known spatial-temporal crowd patterns, the robot will navigate to its destination via less congested areas. Traditional traffic-aware routing methods do not consider spatial-temporal anomalies of macroscopic crowd behaviour that can deviate from the predicted crowd spatial distribution. The proposed method improves long-term path planning adaptivity by integrating a partially updated memory (PUM) model that utilizes observed anomalies to generate a multi-layer crowd density map to improve estimation accuracy. Using this map, we are able to generate a path that has less chance to encounter the crowded areas. Simulation results show that our method outperforms the benchmark congestion-aware routing method in terms of reducing the probability of robot's proximity to dense crowds.","","979-8-3503-2365-8","10.1109/ICRA48891.2023.10160252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10160252","Congestion-Aware Path Planning;Partially Updated Memory;Long-Term Autonomy;Crowd Spatial-Temporal Anomalies","Graphical models;Automation;Navigation;Simulation;Estimation;Benchmark testing;Routing","mobile robots;path planning;probability;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","benchmark congestion-aware routing method;congested areas;congestion-aware path planning method;crowd spatial-temporal anomalies;crowded areas;dense crowds;human occupied environments;known spatial-temporal crowd patterns;long-term autonomy;long-term deployment;long-term path;macroscopic crowd behaviour;mobile robots;multilayer crowd density map;partially updated memory model;predicted crowd spatial distribution;traditional traffic-aware routing methods","","","","26","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
